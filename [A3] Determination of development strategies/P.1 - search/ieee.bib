  abstract={Context: The lack of rigor in research in Computer Science Education, including Software Engineering, has already been discussed and examined in previous researches of the literature in both the theoretical and methodological aspects, which may result in questionable evidence. Aim: Improvement of planning conditions for research in Education in Software Engineering through a Guideline. Methodology: To achieve this objective, a Systematic Literature Review will be carried out to ascertain the gaps found in the literature in Education in Software Engineering, in addition to Interviews with researchers in Education in Software Engineering to report the problems found in research. From this, a Guideline will be modeled using the method Grounded Theory. For model validation, a Survey and Focus groups with researchers in education in Software Engineering. And finally, apply it in a Case Study with researchers in Education in Software Engineering to present the practical contributions of the proposed Guideline.},

  abstract={Background: Some scientific fields, such as automobile, drugs discovery or engineer have used simulation-based studies (SBS) to faster the observation of phenomena and evolve knowledge. All of them organize their working structure to perform computerized experiments based on explicit research protocols and evidence. The benefits have been many and great advancements are continuously obtained for the society. However, could the same approach be observed in Software Engineering (SE)? Are there research protocols and evidence based models available in SE for supporting SBS? Are the studies reports good enough to support their understanding and replication? AIM: To characterize SBS in SE and organize a set of reporting guidelines aiming at improving SBS' understandability, replicability, generalization and validity. METHOD: To undertake a secondary study to characterize SBS. Besides, to assess the quality of reports to understand the usually reported information regarding SBS. RESULTS: From 108 selected papers, it has been observed several relevant initiatives regarding SBS in software engineering. However, most of the reports lack information concerned with the research protocol, simulation model building and evaluation, used data, among others. SBS results are usually specific, making their generalization and comparison hard. No reporting standard has been observed. CONCLUSIONS: Advancements can be observed in SBS in Software Engineering. However, the lack of reporting consistency can reduce understandability, replicability, generalization and compromise their validity. Therefore, an initial set of guidelines is proposed aiming at improving SBS report quality. Further evaluation must be accomplished to assess the guidelines feasibility when used to report SBS in Software Engineering.},

  year={2012},

  pages={29-38},
  abstract={Systematic studies of the literature can be done in different ways. In particular, different guidelines propose different first steps in their recommendations, e.g. start with search strings in different databases or start with the reference lists of a starting set of papers. In software engineering, the main recommended first step is using search strings in a number of databases, while in information systems, snowballing has been recommended as the first step. This paper compares the two different search approaches for conducting literature review studies. The comparison is conducted by searching for articles addressing “Agile practices in global software engineering”. The focus of the paper is on evaluating the two different search approaches. Despite the differences in the included papers, the conclusions and the patterns found in both studies are quite similar. The strengths and weaknesses of each first step are discussed separately and in comparison with each other. It is concluded that none of the first steps is outperforming the other, and the choice of guideline to follow, and hence the first step, may be context-specific, i.e. depending on the area of study.},

  title={SEGRESS: Software Engineering Guidelines for REporting Secondary Studies}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={49},
  number={3},
  pages={1273-1298},
  abstract={Context: Several tertiary studies have criticized the reporting of software engineering secondary studies. Objective: Our objective is to identify guidelines for reporting software engineering (SE) secondary studies which would address problems observed in the reporting of software engineering systematic reviews (SRs). Method: We review the criticisms of SE secondary studies and identify the major areas of concern. We assess the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement as a possible solution to the need for SR reporting guidelines, based on its status as the reporting guideline recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration whose SR guidelines were a major input to the guidelines developed for SE. We report its advantages and limitations in the context of SE secondary studies. We also assess reporting guidelines for mapping studies and qualitative reviews, and compare their structure and content with that of PRISMA 2020. Results: Previous tertiary studies confirm that reports of secondary studies are of variable quality. However, ad hoc recommendations that amend reporting standards may result in unnecessary duplication of text. We confirm that the PRISMA 2020 statement addresses SE reporting problems, but is mainly oriented to quantitative reviews, mixed-methods reviews and meta-analyses. However, we show that the PRISMA 2020 item definitions can be extended to cover the information needed to report mapping studies and qualitative reviews. Conclusions: In this paper and its Supplementary Material, we present and illustrate an integrated set of guidelines called SEGRESS (Software Engineering Guidelines for REporting Secondary Studies), suitable for quantitative systematic reviews (building upon PRISMA 2020), mapping studies (PRISMA-ScR), and qualitative reviews (ENTREQ and RAMESES), that addresses reporting problems found in current SE SRs.},

  abstract={Follow-the-sun (FTS) software development is a strategy used to reduce the length of software projects that are developed across globally distributed locations. However, due to communication and collaboration challenges, software companies find it difficult to adopt this development strategy during task allocation and daily project handovers. In this study, we present results from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) performed on papers published between 1990 and 2012. Our goal was to identify best practices and challenges for FTS implementation. We found 36 best practices and 17 challenges for FTS. These results are discussed in this paper in order to indicate opportunities for future research and make our results useful for the project managers.},

  abstract={This paper is aimed to identify and review the previous studies pertaining to CKMS2P via a systematic and rigorous approach. The objective is to investigate the strategic plan or guideline on how to develop and implement an effective collaborative knowledge management system (KMS) in order to ease the decision making process. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method is used to produce a strategic searching method to select, extract, review and discuss relevant studies concerning the research subject by adapting the guidelines established by [11]. A total of 12 previous studies carried out from 2010 till 2014 have been selected to fulfil this objective through thorough selection. Finding shows that there is a very limited study focusing on the strategic implementation of a KMS to enhance the quality of knowledge services in a collaborative environment. Although there is an increase in the studies that recommended KMS guidelines or strategic planning, the proposed solution were mostly unverified or validated. Therefore, it has become a motivation to conduct a study to propose a Collaborative KMS Strategic Planning Model that can significantly enhance the quality of knowledge services in an organization.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={25-34},
  abstract={Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach that proposes to align business and technical concerns through analysis of the business domain. Microservices practitioners have adopted this approach in software development. However, there is no certainty of the patterns, techniques, and artifacts used. This study analyzes and reports the state of the literature on DDD usage for microservices-based systems development. This study is intended for practitioners and researchers on Microservice Architecture (MSA), DDD, or both. A systematic mapping study followed seven research questions as a guideline, resulting in 27 studies identified to answer the questions through data analysis and synthesis. As a summary of the findings: (i) The microservice identification through domain or legacy system decomposition is the main objective for which DDD was used. (ii) There were 31 MSA systems and 11 design artifacts related to DDD. (iii) Bounded context was the pattern most used for microservices design, followed by Entity and Aggregate. (iv) There were three technologies related to DDD applied in MSA systems design. (v) A total of six techniques used together with DDD were identified. (vi) Six limitations were reported in development descriptions. (vii) Sixteen proposals for MSA systems development with DDD were identified and grouped into five types. As a conclusion of this work, DDD allowed the authors to get a design solution driven by domain knowledge that was detailed using other artifacts, techniques, and proposals.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={By considering skin color, occasion and dress color as input data, this paper proposes a hierarchical cascade classifier to develop a guideline of personalized facial makeup. Although the makeup recommendation system was previously studied in many researches, but the suggestion cannot be applied for a person accurately in real situation. Color tone based on color wheel theory for facial makeup and color selection from individual skin tone were employed in this study. There were two stages of the hierarchical cascade classifier. The first stage was relied on a rule-based classification procedure, in which rules can be generated by investigating input data within the scope of this research together with the data from a professional makeup artist and 250 face images with makeup originated by makeup experts, resulting in primary color of eye shadow, cheek blush color, and lipstick color. Next, machine learning concept was used as the second stage of the hierarchical cascade classifier to indicate secondary color of eye shadow and alternative lipstick color corresponding to a feature vector. Six classification models, which are Multi-Layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression classifier, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, k-nearest neighbor classifier, and Naïve Bayes classifier were selected in this study. From the experimental results, the mixture of rule-based classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron was suitable to be used as a guideline of personalized facial makeup.},
