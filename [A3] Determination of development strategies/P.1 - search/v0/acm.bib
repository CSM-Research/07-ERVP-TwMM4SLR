abstract = {Systematic Mapping Studies (SMSs) are valuable in evidence-based software engineering research. SMSs aim to provide an overview of research, identify gaps and trends, and assess the feasibility of conducting a more focused systematic literature review. In current guidelines for conducting SMSs, a quality assessment of the included papers is suggested only when the research questions explicitly require such a quality assessment. We agree with the recommendation that quality assessment is generally non-mandatory. However, SMSs deal with papers ranging from opinion papers to papers reporting highly rigorous empirical studies. Therefore, in this paper, we argue that analyzing the type of papers is essential for almost every intended purpose of an SMS. Otherwise, without distinguishing papers based on their types, we risk deriving a less informative or incomplete overview or, at worst, a misleading overview of research. Petersen et al. 'encourage' the classification of papers into six paper types as proposed by Wieringa et al.: evaluation research, solution proposal, validation research, philosophical papers, opinion papers, and personal experience papers. Given the lenient guidelines on assessing the quality of included studies, we recommend a stronger focus on classifying papers by type.},

abstract = {To systematically collect evidence and to structure a given area in software engineering (SE), Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) and Systematic Mapping (SM) studies have become common. Data extraction is one of the main phases (activities) when conducting an SM or an SLR, whose objective is to extract required data from the primary studies and to accurately record the information researchers need to answer the questions of the SM/SLR study. Based on experience in a large number of SM/SLR studies, we and many other researchers have found the data extraction in SLRs to be time consuming and error-prone, thus raising the real need for heuristics and guidelines for effective and efficient data extraction in these studies, especially to be learnt by junior and young researchers. As a 'guideline' paper, this paper contributes a synthesized list of challenges usually faced during SLRs' data extraction phase and the corresponding solutions (guidelines). For our synthesis, we consider two data sources: (1) the pool of 16 SLR studies in which the authors have been involved in, as well as (2) a review of challenges and guidelines in the existing literature. Our experience in utilizing the presented guidelines in the near past have helped our junior colleagues to conduct data extractions more effectively and efficiently.},

abstract = {Context: Quantum Computing (QC) systems exploit the characteristics of quantum mechanics to perform computationally demanding tasks more effectually than their classical counterparts. To utilize the full potential of QC systems, Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) has emerged to manage the challenges of quantum software development. Problem: Due to the lack of awareness of QC problem domains and their associated factors to consider and apply QC in the Software Engineering (SE) process, the development of a QC system becomes complex and less cost effective if without a guidance for software engineers. Objective: The proposed work aims to develop a systematic decision-making framework to help identify the quantum problem domains and prioritize the critical factors to be considered for the application of QC during the software development life cycle (SDLC). Method: The proposed method is implemented in two folds. First, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed to identify a set of QC problem domains and their associated factors that should be accounted for in the SE process. Second, an online survey is conducted to collect insights on the same aspects from practitioners in their SE processes to form another set of data. Finally, the relationships of the two sets are validated through careful mappings with the assistance of domain experts. Results: Five problem domains and six factors are classified by the proposed methodology, and some of them will benefit from a QC-based solution in the SE process. The results indicate that "Algorithm Development" and "Language Development" are two potential problem domains to apply a QC-based solution. For these two domains, "Current Hardware Limitations", "Standardized Coding Practices" and "Software Specialization/Adaptation" are the critical factors to be considered during the SE process. Conclusion: Organizations and QSE community can take advantage of the identified problem domains and their associated factors to make decisions in the recommendation of QC-based solutions.},

abstract = {Producing secure software is challenging. The poor usability of security Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) makes this even harder. Many recommendations have been proposed to support developers by improving the usability of cryptography libraries—rooted in wider best practice guidance in software engineering and API design. In this SLR, we systematize knowledge regarding these recommendations. We identify and analyze 65 papers, offering 883 recommendations. Through thematic analysis, we identify seven core ways to improve usability of APIs. Most of the recommendations focus on helping API developers to construct and structure their code and make it more usable and easier for programmers to understand. There is less focus, however, on documentation, writing requirements, code quality assessment, and the impact of organizational software development practices. By tracing and analyzing paper ancestry, we map how this knowledge becomes validated and translated over time. We find that very few API usability recommendations are empirically validated, and that recommendations specific to usable security APIs lag even further behind.},

abstract = {Context: An essential part of conducting software engineering (SE) research is the ability to identify extant research on tools, technologies, concepts and methods in order to evaluate and make rational and scientific decisions. The domain from which such knowledge is extracted is typically existing research literature found in journals, conference proceedings, books and gray literature. Empirical approaches that include various systematic review (SR) methodologies such as systematic literature review (SLR) and systematic mapping study (SMS) are found to be effective in this context. They adopt rigorous planning, follow repeatable and well-defined processes, and produce unbiased and evidence-based outcomes. Despite these significant benefits, the general trend on using these systematic review (SR) methodologies is not encouraging in SE research. The primary reasons emerging are twofold - a) SR methodologies are largely cited as time-consuming activities and b) lack of guidance to conduct systematic reviews. This tutorial discusses these concerns and describes an effective way of using SR methodologies for SE research.Objectives: Attendees will be introduced to the key concepts, methods and processes for conducting systematic literature reviews (SLR) and systematic mapping studies (SMS). The benefits, limitations, guidelines for using SR methodologies in an effective manner will discussed in the session. Attendees will be guided on the appropriate formulation of a research question and sub questions; the development of a review protocol such as inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, quality criteria and classification structures; and execution of review protocol using digital libraries and syntheses of review data. A web based software tool1, for supporting the systematic literature review process will be demonstrated and attendees will get the opportunity to use the tool to conduct the review to help in identification of relevant research and extraction and synthesis of data.Method: We will use a blend of information presentation, interactive hands-on session and knowledge sharing session. The presentation will introduce the key concepts, benefits, limitations and how to overcome the limitations; hands on session will illustrate a review process with a case study, and finally the knowledge sharing session will discuss the experiences, best practices and the lesson learnt.},

abstract = {Context: In the last years, diverse research areas increased their interest in Grey Literature (GL). In Software Engineering (SE), SE practitioners became heavy consumers of GL, by way of contrast to traditional research papers. Problem: This is unfortunate, in particular, although the increase of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) published, researchers, claim to the lack of them of connection to the practice. Goal: Propose and evaluate a set of guidelines to help SE researchers to conduct a Grey Literature Review (GLR) that are more in line with practitioners' needs. Method: First, we are conducting a tertiary study to understand how secondary studies use GL. Second, we plan to employ qualitative research with researchers of SLRs and SE practitioners. Third, we plan to review and analyze the use of GL source according to the context in SE. Fourth, we plan to conduct a GLR. Finally, we plan to perform and evaluate our guideline. Preliminary Results: The tertiary study retrieved a total of 14,043 papers. We removed the duplicate studies and also which were not peer-reviewed articles. Currently, we are solving the conflicts of disagreement of the selection process. Conclusions: We present preliminary findings, show our proposed approach and the next steps.},

Such remarks are barriers to promoting diversity and inclusion in the software engineering (SE) domain.Aims: This study aims to develop a rubric to identify misogynistic remarks and sexist jokes specifically from software developer communications.Method: We have followed the systematic literature review protocol to identify 10 primary studies that have characterized misogynistic and sexist texts in various domains.Results: Based on our syntheses of the primary studies, we have developed a rubric to manually identity various categories of misogynistic or sexist remarks. We have also provided SE domain specific examples of those categories.Conclusions: Our annotation guideline will pave the path towards building automated misogynistic text classifier for the SE domain.},

abstract = {Systematic studies of the literature can be done in different ways. In particular, different guidelines propose different first steps in their recommendations, e.g. start with search strings in different databases or start with the reference lists of a starting set of papers.In software engineering, the main recommended first step is using search strings in a number of databases, while in information systems, snowballing has been recommended as the first step. This paper compares the two different search approaches for conducting literature review studies.The comparison is conducted by searching for articles addressing "Agile practices in global software engineering". The focus of the paper is on evaluating the two different search approaches.Despite the differences in the included papers, the conclusions and the patterns found in both studies are quite similar. The strengths and weaknesses of each first step are discussed separately and in comparison with each other.It is concluded that none of the first steps is outperforming the other, and the choice of guideline to follow, and hence the first step, may be context-specific, i.e. depending on the area of study.},
