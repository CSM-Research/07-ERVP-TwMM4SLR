============= Grounded Theory Literature Review ======================

Scope: find any key practices for the systematic literature review process. Those practices should be in the format of guideline, threat to validity mitigation action, lesson learned.

Questions: Which are the key practices for systematic literature review process?


Inclusion/exclusion criteria: 

	IC1: The study presents key practices, best practices, lessons learned or any recommendation to improve SLR process
	IC2: The study is in software engineering area


	EC1: the study is about SLR but does not include any practice/guideline/lesson learned for the process
	EC2: the study is not in software engineering area
	EC3: the study is not in english
	EC4: is not a primary or secondary study (workshop publicity, short papers, etc.)
	EC5: the study is an older version than other already considered

CONDUCTION
----------------------


First, we performed the deduplication and removal of obvious entries that were not papers (Proceedings announcements). 
• 39 duplicated
• 10 proceedings announcements

The second step, was to create 4 batches of studies (with 87 studies) to perform the selection. 

Results: 

• 22 included - 75 excluded - 38 duplicated
• X included - X excluded
• X included - X excluded
• X included - X excluded

PROMPT for data extraction
-----------------------------

Carefully analyze the provided article and extract all exact textual quotes that describe recommendations, best practices, lessons learned, or actions to mitigate bias, and also interpret assessment criterion as a recommendation for the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process.

Requirements:


Always return the exact literal quote (do not paraphrase).
Do not duplicate information: if a quote appears multiple times in the paper, list it only once.
Each quote must appear on a separate line.
Include the page or section reference as a second field.
Format each line as CSV: wrap each field in double quotes, separate the quote and reference with a comma.
If no relevant quotes exist, return nothing.


Do not include extra text or explanations — output only the lines.

Output in a table with two columns: text-passage, code, dimension

the text-passage should be the raw text, 
the code should be a 1-4 words code that synthezises the text-passage
the dimension should be classified in: Coverage, Efficiency, Knowledge management, Validation & Reliability, Documentation & transparency, Tool Support, Collaboration & communication, Availability &
Reproducibility

PROMPT for KP generation
-----------------------------

Use the data from the file to define Key Practices (KP) for the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process.


The output must be a table in plain text with four columns:


KP# → a sequential integer (1, 2, 3, …)
Description → a concise statement that synthesizes the data into a clear Key Practice for SLR
References → the IDs from the file that support this practice (e.g., S1, S2…)
Instances → short examples of how to accomplish the practice


KP# | Description | References | Instances
1 | It is important to define a clear quality assurance process | S1, S3 | Create a quality assessment checklist; Apply inter-rater agreement checks


Generate the full table following this structure.
