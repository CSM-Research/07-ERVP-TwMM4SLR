abstract = {A world becoming more digitally transformed and connected poses significant challenges for IT organizations, requiring increased attention to the usability of their software products and, consequently, to the systematic establishment of usability engineering (UE) processes. Typically, the establishment of software processes is guided by software process capability/maturity models (SPCMMs), such as CMMI or ISO/IEC 15504. However, it seems that these commonly adopted models do not explicitly cover usability engineering (UE) processes. Thus, a question that arises is, if there exist process capability/maturity models focusing explicitly on usability engineering? If yes, to which degree do they assist in the assessment process? To answer this, we conducted a systematic literature review on usability capability/maturity models (UCMMs). A total of 15 UCMMs were identified and analyzed, synthesizing information on their measurement framework and process reference model, usage support and how they have been developed/validated. We observed that most of the models are based on consolidated SPCMMs, such as CMMI or ISO/IEC 15504. Only few UCMMs customized for specific contexts were found. Although all UCMMs propose or reference a measurement framework, only 5 UCMMs define a proper process reference model. Most of the models also do not offer support for their usage, which may hinder their larger scale adoption in practice. Furthermore, we noted a lack of information on how most of the models have been developed and validated, which leaves their validity questionable. These results indicate the need for further research on UCMMs taking into consideration the increased importance of usability in software product quality.}

abstract = {Background: Software Process Improvement (SPI) is intended to improve software engineering, but can only be effective if used. To improve SPI’s uptake, we should understand why organizations adopt SPI. CMM-based SPI approaches are widely known and studied. Objective: We investigated why organizations adopt CMM-based SPI approaches, and how these motivations relate to organizations’ size. Method: We performed a systematic review, examining reasons reported in more than forty primary studies. Results: Reasons usually related to product quality and project performance, and less commonly, to process. Organizations reported customer reasons infrequently and employee reasons very rarely. We could not show that reasons related to size. Conclusion: Despite its origins in helping to address customer-related issues for the USAF, CMM-based SPI has mostly been adopted to help organizations improve project performance and product quality issues. This reinforces a view that the goal of SPI is not to improve process per se, but instead to provide business benefits.}

Circular supply chains, characterized by their restorative and regenerative nature, inherently introduce operational complexities. Concurrently, hyperconnectivity is evolving as a pervasive reality, defined by the extensive and intricate interconnectedness among actors across multiple layers. Specifically, we investigate the potential of the Physical Internet, a hyperconnected global logistics system, to facilitate the implementation of circular supply chains. Our approach includes a systematic literature review to map the current landscape and the development of a novel conceptual framework. This framework, merging the Physical Internet and circular supply chain concepts, identifies ten interrelated characteristics from various aspects such as product design, production, logistics, supply chain asset utilization, product usage, recovery, performance monitoring, material and energy exchange, as well as technology and business model innovation. Additionally, we introduce a four-stage maturity model to evaluate and improve companies' circular supply chain practices systematically. Its practical application is illustrated through two cases in automobile and sport garment industry respectively. This study is among the first to explore the integration of hyperconnectivity in logistics management into implementing circular supply chains. It lays a theoretical foundation and suggests actionable strategies.}

This research analyzes the current knowledge regarding the use of maturity models (MMs) in SSCM, aiming to identify the main characteristics, trends and research gaps on the subject. Facing the growing interest in carrying out studies directed at sustainability, to the detriment of more prescient environmental and social impacts and the need to consolidate the concepts present in the literature regarding the SSCM, an absence of similar studies in the current literature was found. The authors have selected articles to compose a database that allows users to analyze and classify publications on MMs in SSCM, being those subdivided into 7 categories: focus, methodology, analyzed sector, sustainable practices, dimensions of sustainable development, type of MM and model/framework validation method.
Design/methodology/approach
To achieve this purpose, a literature systematization was conducted by searching publications using defined keywords in two databases and following a process of classification. The systematic process has five steps, from the selection of databases to the filtering of publications, review of information and analysis of the sample.
Findings
The topic under study is promising, with a few publications dealing with it, mainly in Brazil, and there is a trend to exploit more of the area in future research.
Originality/value
This research provides a detailed analysis of an emerging theme, divided into seven thematic categories. Results demonstrate that the topic is still underexplored, indicating an important research gap to be filled.}

However, lack of skilled personnel, cost of testing automation, and maintenance of script along with others oppose the widespread adoption of automation in testing. The work proposed by this study is in line with the development of Systematic Process Improvement Model for Testing Automation, abbreviated as SPIM-TA. The model is inspired from Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Software Outsourcing Vendor Readiness Model (SOVRM) maturity-level-based framework. The research was done based on a four-phased methodology. In the first phase, a systematic literature review identified 14 critical challenges in software testing automation with practices or solutions for each of these challenges. In the second round, a survey questionnaire is used to validate these findings in industrial context and extract more practical insights from case studies. This dual approach had ensured both academic rigor and the relevance of the practices with industry. The third one involved developing SPIM-TA by incorporating insights that come from the SLR and those results of the survey as well. The framework defines five maturity levels, systematically addressing the identified challenges and providing a structured pathway for organizations to enhance their automation processes. In the fourth phase, case studies of industrial applications were carried out to evaluate SPIM-TA’s efficiency. The applicability, scalability, and impact of the framework on testing automation in the real world were assessed using the Motorola Assessment Tool. The findings illustrate the systematic way SPIM-TA will help overcome the automation challenge, so that organizations can reach more advanced levels of maturity and efficiency in their testing processes. In the first place, the present study closes the gap between academia and industry but at the same time paves the foundation for future research into the automation of software testing.}

abstract = {Context
Software testing practices and processes in many companies are far from being mature and are usually conducted in ad-hoc fashions. Such immature practices lead to various negative outcomes, e.g., ineffectiveness of testing practices in detecting all the defects, and cost and schedule overruns of testing activities. To conduct test maturity assessment (TMA) and test process improvement (TPI) in a systematic manner, various TMA/TPI models and approaches have been proposed.
Objective
It is important to identify the state-of-the-art and the –practice in this area to consolidate the list of all various test maturity models proposed by practitioners and researchers, the drivers of TMA/TPI, the associated challenges and the benefits and results of TMA/TPI. Our article aims to benefit the readers (both practitioners and researchers) by providing the most comprehensive survey of the area, to this date, in assessing and improving the maturity of test processes.
Method
To achieve the above objective, we have performed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) study to find out what we know about TMA/TPI. A MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). We searched the academic literature using the Google Scholar and the grey literature using the regular Google search engine.
Results
Our MLR and its results are based on 181 sources, 51 (29%) of which were grey literature and 130 (71%) were formally published sources. By summarizing what we know about TMA/TPI, our review identified 58 different test maturity models and a large number of sources with varying degrees of empirical evidence on this topic. We also conducted qualitative analysis (coding) to synthesize the drivers, challenges and benefits of TMA/TPI from the primary sources.
Conclusion
We show that current maturity models and techniques in TMA/TPI provides reasonable advice for industry and the research community. We suggest directions for follow-up work, e.g., using the findings of this MLR in industry-academia collaborative projects and empirical evaluation of models and techniques in the area of TMA/TPI as reported in this article.}

Innovation such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and blockchain is not only confined to the manufacturing industry but covers the whole of human life. Notwithstanding the said innovation, it also gives rise to cybercrimes with these technologies’ assistance. The botnet called Mirai is one example of compromising the technology in IR 4.0 to launch large-scale cyberattacks through Internet access. It is therefore crucial for the digital forensic (DF) organization to be ready to handle this kind of incident. This paper aims to provide the indicators for DF organizations’ maturity and readiness in the era of IR 4.0. To establish the indicators, a systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted. It involves four phases in the SLR, where the focus is; (1) challenges of DF in IR 4.0, (2) chain of custody and DF readiness, (3) existing maturity model, and (4) benchmarking the maturity element, respectively. It covers the research studies taken from five databases. From the comparison analysis, this study has derived five indicators for the maturity and readiness of DF organization: (1) People and capacity development, (2) Organization, policy and cooperation, (3) Process, (4) Technology and technical, (5) Legislation and regulation. Finally the work outlines the DF practices based on the CMMI ver. 2 practice areas and potential governance and management objectives that can govern the DF organization.}

This study seeks to evaluate, synthesize, and present results on the use of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) in combination with agile software development, and thereafter to give an overview of the topics researched, which includes a discussion of their benefits and limitations, the strength of the findings, and the implications for research and practice.
Methods
The method applied was a Systematic Literature Review on studies published up to (and including) 2011.
Results
The search strategy identified 3193 results, of which 81 included studies on the use of CMMI together with agile methodologies. The benefits found were grouped into two main categories: those related to the organization in general and those related to the development process, and were organized into subcategories, according to the area to which they refer. The limitations were also grouped into these categories. Using the criteria defined, the strength of the evidence found was considered low. The implications of the results for research and practice are discussed.
Conclusion
Agile methodologies can be used by companies to reduce efforts in getting to levels 2 and 3 of CMMI, there even being reports of applying agile practices that led to achieving level 5. However, agile methodologies alone, according to the studies, were not sufficient to obtain a rating at a given level, it being necessary to resort to additional practices to do so.}

Digital health in hospital settings is viewed as a panacea for achieving the “quadruple aim” of health care, yet the outcomes have been largely inconclusive. To optimize digital health outcomes, a strategic approach is necessary, requiring digital maturity assessments. However, current approaches to assessing digital maturity have been largely insufficient, with uncertainty surrounding the dimensions to assess.
Objective
The aim of this study was to identify the current dimensions used to assess the digital maturity of hospitals.
Methods
A systematic literature review was conducted of peer-reviewed literature (published before December 2020) investigating maturity models used to assess the digital maturity of hospitals. A total of 29 relevant articles were retrieved, representing 27 distinct maturity models. The articles were inductively analyzed, and the maturity model dimensions were extracted and consolidated into a maturity model framework.
Results
The consolidated maturity model framework consisted of 7 dimensions: strategy; information technology capability; interoperability; governance and management; patient-centered care; people, skills, and behavior; and data analytics. These 7 dimensions can be evaluated based on 24 respective indicators.
Conclusions
The maturity model framework developed for this study can be used to assess digital maturity and identify areas for improvement.}

The number of maturity models proposed in the area of Business Process Management (BPM) has increased considerably in the last decade. However, there are a number of challenges, such as the limited empirical studies on their validation and a limited extent of actionable properties of these models in guiding their application. These challenges hinder the widespread usage of the maturity models in the BPM field.
Objective
In order to better understand the state of the research on business process maturity models (BPMMs) and identify opportunities for future research, we conducted a systematic literature review.
Method
We searched the studies between the years 1990 and 2014 in established digital libraries to identify empirical studies of BPMMs by focusing on their development, validation, and application. We targeted studies on generic models proposed for business process maturity, business process management or orientation maturity, and selected 61 studies out of 2899 retrieved initially.
Results
We found that despite that many BPMMs were proposed in the last decade, the level of empirical evidence that reveals the validity and usefulness of these models is scarce.
Conclusion
The current state of research on BPM maturity is in its early phases, and academic literature lacks methodical applications of many mainstream BPMMs that have been proposed. Future research should be directed towards: (1) reconciling existing models with a strong emphasis on prescriptive properties, (2) conducting empirical studies to demonstrate the validity and usefulness of BPMMs, and (3) separating the assessment method used to evaluate the maturity level from the maturity model which acts as the reference framework for the assessment.}

abstract = {Transformation of the energy sector to a safer, cleaner, and more economical business is increasingly becoming important, in an era in which many countries have pledged to meet net-zero emissions energy. The best possible strategy for this transformation of production, transportation and consumption of energy can be found by modelling the energy system using capable modelling tools and envisioning future needs ahead of time. There is great interest, but lack of information about these tools and trends in the literature. To fill this gap, the paper systematically overviews modelling capabilities, technical criteria and the usability of thirty energy modelling tools that are currently available. Results show that, selected tools cover satisfactory ranges of modelling resolution in time and space. Nevertheless, no single tool covers all, short-term, medium-term and long-term planning horizons over a local geographical area to global level. Moreover, state-of-the-art energy system modelling and insights on future energy modelling needs are also elaborated on in the paper. The challenges of cross-sector and cross-border modelling, uncertainty modelling and forward market modelling and plausible solutions for them are discussed. The paper can be used in aid of selecting a suitable tool for a specific energy modelling purpose and attaining insights on future modelling needs that are required to obtain carbon neutrality by 2050.}

Thereby, the maturity model is an effective tool to assess the current capabilities and the future needs of an organization, process, or group. This study had two phases. The first phase identified the core literature on maturity models for library services and management. The second evaluated the specifications of the maturity models employed or derived for library services and management. A total of 12 maturity models were selected for the study. The selected models were reviewed based on 18 parameters, out of which nine were adopted from the literature study, and the authors identified nine others. These parameters were classified based on descriptive, structural, and administrative attributes of the models. The parameters help to identify the most appropriate maturity model for implementing it in a library or information center. Results show that several domain-specific free and commercial maturity models can improve the library and information services. Library and information professionals should utilize the opportunity available in user training and community support for maturity models to foster information services.}

Although Blockchain technology receives considerable attention from both the public and academia, the question of how Blockchain technology leverages patent management in particular has so far been neglected, although it holds great promise. Consequently, this is what we choose to be our basic research question. In response to it, we conduct a systematic literature review, following a procedure in three steps. Out of an initial sample of 714 articles, we select 52 as being particularly relevant, and classify them in accordance with the dimensions of the 7D Patent Management Maturity Model. Three main foci regarding the use of Blockchain technology emerge – i.e. for the generation, the enforcement, and the exploitation of patents. This study contributes to scholarship and management by showing that Blockchain technology mitigates environmental and behavioral uncertainty, while stimulating new governance forms and business models by reorganizing or discarding stakeholders.}

Agile approaches are an alternative for organizations developing software, particularly for those who develop Web applications. Besides, CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) models are well-established approaches focused on assessing the maturity of an organization that develops software. Web Engineering is the field of Software Engineering responsible for analyzing and studying the specific characteristics of the Web. The suitability of an Agile approach to help organizations reach a certain CMMI maturity level in Web environments will be very interesting, as they will be able to keep the ability to quickly react and adapt to changes as long as their development processes get mature.
Objective
This paper responds to whether it is feasible or not, for an organization developing Web systems, to achieve a certain maturity level of the CMMI-DEV model using Agile methods.
Method
The proposal is analyzed by means of a systematic literature review of the relevant approaches in the field, defining a characterization schema in order to compare them to introduce the current state-of-the-art.
Results
The results achieved after the systematic literature review are presented, analyzed and compared against the defined schema, extracting relevant conclusions for the different dimensions of the problem: compatibility, compliance, experience, maturity and Web.
Conclusion
It is concluded that although the definition of an Agile approach to meet the different CMMI maturity levels goals could be possible for an organization developing Web systems, there is still a lack of detailed studies and analysis on the field.}

To this end, a Systematic Mapping Study was carried out considering high-quality published research from four relevant digital libraries since 2000. The 78 primary studies analysed show several gaps and challenges. In particular, a common ontology has not been achieved, and Innovation Management Systems are scarcely considered. Concepts such as open innovation have not been correctly applied to incorporate all Quadruple Helix stakeholders, especially the government and its role as a public funder. This implies that no studies explore a standard agile public–private maturity model based on capabilities since the public funders’ restrictions have not been considered. Furthermore, although some concepts of innovation capabilities have evolved, none of the studies analysed offer a comprehensive coverage of capabilities. As potential future lines of research, this paper proposes 11 challenges based on the 5 shortcomings found in the literature.}

This paper aims to clarify the uncertainty reflected in the current state of information security maturity evaluation where it has not enough matured and converged so that a generic approach or many specfics approaches become the go-to choice. In fact, in the past decade, many secruity maturity models are still being produced and remain unproven regardless of the existence of ISO 21827.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors have used the systematic literature review to summarize existing research, help identify gaps in the existing literature and provide background for positioning new research studies.
Findings
The authors highlighted the prevalent influence of the ISO/IEC 27001/27002 standard but raised the necessity for an in-depth investigation of ISO 21827. The authors also made the implementation facet a central topic of our review. The authors found out that, compared to the number of proposed models, implementation experiments are lacking. This could be due to the arduous task of validation and it could also be the reason why specific models are dominant.
Originality/value
While the research literature contains many experience reports and a few case studies on information security maturity evaluation, a systematic review and synthesis of this growing field of research is unavailable as far as the authors know. In fact, the authors only picked-up one bodywork [Maturity models in cyber security A systematic review (2017)] carrying out a literature review on security maturity models between 2012 and 2017, written in Spanish.}

The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) related technologies for manufacturing firms are well recognized, however, there is a lack of industrial AI (I-AI) maturity models to enable companies to understand where they are and plan where they should go. The purpose of this study is to propose a comprehensive maturity model in order to help manufacturing firms assess their performance in the I-AI journey, shed lights on future improvement, and eventually realize their smart manufacturing visions.
Design/methodology/approach
This study is based on (1) a systematic review of literature on assessing I-AI-related technologies to identify relevant measured indicators in the maturity model, and (2) semi-structured interviews with domain experts to determine maturity levels of the established model.
Findings
The I-AI maturity model developed in this study includes two main dimensions, namely “Industry” and “Artificial Intelligence”, together with 12 first-level indicators and 35 second-level indicators under these dimensions. The maturity levels are divided into five types: planning level, specification level, integration level, optimization level, and leading level.
Originality/value
The maturity model integrates indicators that can be used to assess AI-related technologies and extend the existing maturity models of smart manufacturing by adding specific technical and nontechnical capabilities of these technologies applied in the industrial context. The integration of the industry and artificial intelligence dimensions with the maturity levels shows a road map to improve the capability of applying AI-related technologies throughout the product lifecycle for achieving smart manufacturing.}

The study aims to review the currently available Industry 4.0 (I4.0) maturity models (MMs) for manufacturing industries and analyse their applicability in the oil and gas (O&G) upstream sector. Knowing that the growth in demand for energy through crude oil and natural gas is still viable over the next decade, there is the drive to ensure sustenance and improvement in production. The study sees an opportunity in harnessing the gains of Industry 4.0 technologies for better solution-driven strategies in production processes, equipment availability and reliability which would translate into higher production performance. So, a review on the Industry 4.0 MMs is considered important.
Design/methodology/approach
A systematic and in-depth literature review was performed to identify the specific requirements of this industry. This study examined the key characteristics of the O&G upstream sector and identified research gaps that need to be addressed to successfully support this industry for Industry 4.0 implementation. An Industry 4.0 MM that reflects the industrial realities for this industry more accurately from insights drawn from reviews of existing MMs is proposed
Findings
The review of 19 selected Industry 4.0 MMs revealed that the existing MMs are not a direct fit for the O&G upstream industry. Only a few of the models were clear on validation but with subjectivity, low number of persons and industries involved as limitations; none of the models confirmed validation with the O&G industry. There are varying views on the model dimensions and maturity levels by each author and not all required areas specific to the O&G industries were acknowledged by the models. An MM specific to this industry is therefore required.
Originality/value
Although the journey of digitisation has commenced in the O&G industry, a reduction with the challenges of transition towards Industry 4.0 implementation and provision of support for improved efficiency is assured using a robust MM, as proposed in this paper.}

In the Industry 4.0 context, several terms are used to express the model, such as readiness assessment model, roadmap, framework, and maturity index. They have the same purpose of measuring how the current state of an organization unit is capable of adopting and implementing the concept of industry 4.0 in the future. Many researchers had proposed maturity models for assessing Industry 4.0 readiness and maturity since 2011 when Industry 4.0 was commenced. However, there has been no attempt to analyze empirical evidence systematically. This paper aims to analyze currently available maturity models related to Industry 4.0 and provide a synthesis on those maturity models. This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies implemented on the maturity model published in several reputable and relevant sources. It focuses on the manufacturing and logistics sectors since the processes in both sectors can be highly improved through the introduction of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and artificial intelligence. In general, the primary purpose of the review is to address the following questions: (1) Based on what dimensions do researchers develop Industry 4.0 maturity models, and what are the most used and influencing parameters in those dimensions? (2) How do those maturity models compare to each other in terms of dimension complexity, techniques, maturity leveling, and kind of application sectors of the model? In conclusion, the maturity model in the context of Industry 4.0 is promising to guide the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies at the organization level. However, just having a maturity model is not enough. More efforts are needed to facilitate the application of it.}

Further we have categorized the identified CSFs into five partnership levels based on Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Software Outsourcing Vendors’ Readiness Model (SOVRM). To validate the SLR findings and to find practices for the identified CSFs a questionnaire survey was conducted in the outsourcing industry in which 35 experts, from 8 different countries participated. Two case studies were conducted for evaluation of the SOPM. In this paper our newly developed model, SOPM, has been presented in detail. SOPM has been built with the intent to assist SDO vendor organizations in measuring their capabilities for successful conversion of their contractual outsourcing relationship to outsourcing partnership.}

Its application has demonstrated promising potential in advancing project quality and construction efficiency.

A quantitative MM further provides insights and benchmarks for technological advancement and functional completeness. The study firstly proposes a five-level maturity hierarchy based on systematic literature review and specialities of underground infrastructure. A qualitative evaluation system is constructed comprising 5 dimensions and 13 rubrics. Considering the interdependencies among rubrics, a D-ANP (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory & Analytical Network Process) method is utilized to evaluate the maturity level and assign weights to rubrics. Effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed MM are demonstrated through case studies involving subway station and tunnel DTs. The results indicate that the MM provides valuable perspectives and enables cross-disciplinary and multi-phase comparisons of DTs from the technological perspective.}

abstract = {Context:
Organizations are increasingly connecting software applications using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to share data, services, functionality, and even complete business processes. However, the creation and management of APIs is non-trivial. Aspects such as traffic management, community engagement, documentation, and version management are often rushed afterthoughts.
Objective:
In this research, we present and evaluate a focus area maturity model for API Management (API-m-FAMM). A focus area maturity model can be used to establish the maturity level of an organization in a specific functional domain described through a number of areas. The API-m-FAMM addresses the areas Lifecycle Management, Security, Performance, Observability, Community, and Commercial.
Method:
The model is constructed using established methods for the design of a focus area maturity model. It is grounded in literature and practice, and was developed and evaluated through a systematic literature Review, eleven expert interviews, and five case studies at software producing organizations.
Result:
The model is described in detail, and its application is illustrated by six case studies.
Conclusions:
The evaluations are reported on, and show that the API-m-FAMM is an efficient tool for aiding organizations in gaining a better understanding of their current implementation of API management practices, and provides them with guidance towards higher levels of maturity. The detailed description of the construction of the API-m-FAMM gives researchers an example to further support the available methodologies, specifically how to combine design science research with these methodologies. Additionally, this study’s unique case study design shows that maturity models can be successfully deployed in practice with minimal involvement of researchers. The focus area maturity model for API Management is maintained on www.maturitymodels.org, allowing practitioners to benefit from its useful insights.}

The aim of this paper is to develop a Requirements Engineering (RE) Security Maturity Model (RESMM) to assist software development organizations to better specify the requirements for secure software development. To achieve this objective, first, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the requirement practices for secure software development. Then we modified Sommerville's requirements engineering practices. We also conducted a questionnaire survey based on the identified security requirements practices. Next, the RESMM was built based on the results of the SLR, the modified Sommerville practices and feedback from the security practitioners. Finally, two case studies were conducted to assess RESMM. RESMM has 79 practices classified into 7 RE categories. The case study results show that RESMM has a clear structure and is easy to comprehend and use. In addition, the case study participants recommended that software organizations adopt RESMM. RESMM has the ability to identify the RE security maturity levels in software organizations. RESMM can also help software development organizations deliver secure software.}

abstract = {Background
Digital health has become integral to public health care, advancing how services are accessed, delivered, and managed. Health organizations increasingly assess their digital health maturity to leverage these innovations fully. However, existing digital health maturity models (DHMMs) primarily focus on technology and infrastructure, often neglecting critical communication components.
Objective
This systematic review addresses gaps in DHMMs by identifying deficiencies in user communication elements and proposing the digital health communication maturity model (DHCMM). The DHCMM integrates critical health communication dimensions such as satisfaction, engagement, personalization, and customization to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework.
Methods
We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to conduct a systematic review of studies selected from 3 databases: EBSCO, PubMed, and ProQuest. Studies were screened and included based on their focus on digital health maturity and communication elements, with the final selection limited to English-language research addressing DHMMs.
Results
Of the 1138 initially identified studies, 31 (2.72%) met the inclusion criteria. Current DHMMs heavily emphasize infrastructure while overlooking user engagement and communication; for instance, only 35% (11/31) of the reviewed models incorporated user satisfaction, and less than one-fifth (6/31, 19%) addressed personalization or customization. The DHCMM addresses these gaps with 7 maturity levels, ranging from initial to engaged, and emphasizes user-centered metrics and governance. Quantitative analysis showed substantial variations in communication metrics, with satisfaction metrics incorporated at an average rate of 22% (7/31) across the reviewed models.
Conclusions
The DHCMM shifts the focus of digital health maturity assessments by emphasizing communication and user engagement. This model provides health care organizations with a structured framework to enhance digital health initiatives, leading to better patient outcomes and system-wide efficiencies. The model delivers actionable insights for organizations aiming to achieve advanced digital maturity by addressing underrepresented dimensions. Future research should implement and refine the DHCMM across diverse health care contexts to enhance its effectiveness. The adoption of this model could result in more equitable, user-centered health care systems that integrate technological advancements with human-centered care.}

Its immutable nature facilitates enhanced management of SCML activities by seamlessly integrating information flow throughout the value chain, and substantially increasing data integrity and operational reliability. While organizations are attracted to these capabilities, they still lack comprehensive guidelines to fully benefit from blockchain in SCML. There is a fundamental need to assist organizations in assessing and enhancing their blockchain-based SCML capabilities. Maturity models (MMs) are tools that help organizations assess and improve their processes, providing step-by-step guidelines from basic to advanced levels of maturity. Therefore, this study aims to identify and analyze MMs focused on blockchain-based SCML. An extensive systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted, and thirteen relevant studies were identified and evaluated against a comprehensive set of quality criteria. The analysis revealed that none of the existing MMs fully satisfied all criteria, highlighting a significant gap in the field. This research provides a thorough systematic analysis of MMs for blockchain-based SCML, offering an in-depth view of their levels, dimensions, research focuses, domains, industry targets, and their quality evaluation. The significance of this study lies in identifying the necessity for an MM specifically designed for blockchain-based SCML, addressing a critical gap in the current literature. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on blockchain integration in SCML and provide a foundation for future research.}

Although current ITG research is largely focused on hard governance (structure, processes), soft governance (behavior, collaboration) is equally important and might be crucial to close the gap. The goal of this study is to determine if there remains a mismatch and test the usability of a new ITG maturity model. We conducted a systematic literature review to create an overview of available ITG maturity models, used one of these in ten case studies and evaluated its usability. The study shows five new models were introduced, and only one of the new ITG maturity models covers hard and soft ITG in detail. This model and corresponding instrument was used to test its usability in practice. The instrument was evaluated positively on usability; but feedback also revealed that the assessment questions needed improvements. We demonstrate that combining the instrument with structured interviews results in an enhanced and usable instrument to determine an organization’s current level of hard and soft ITG. We conclude that this new instrument demonstrates a way to reduce the mismatch between ITG maturity theory and practice.}

Given the potential negative impact machine learning (ML) can have on people, society or the environment, engineering techniques that can ensure robustness against technical errors and adversarial attacks are of considerable importance. In this work, we investigate how teams of experts develop, deploy and maintain software with ML components. Moreover, we link what teams do to the effects they aim to achieve and provide means for improvement. Towards this goal, we performed a mixed-methods study with a sequential exploratory strategy. First, we performed a systematic literature review through which we mined both academic and grey literature, and compiled a catalogue of engineering practices for ML. Second, we validated this catalogue using a large-scale survey, which measured the degree of adoption of the practices and their perceived effects. Third, we ran validation interviews with practitioners to add depth to the survey results. The catalogue covers a broad range of practices for engineering software systems with ML components and for ensuring non-functional properties that fall under the umbrella of trustworthy ML, such as fairness, security or accountability. Here, we present the results of our study, which indicate, for example, that larger and more experienced teams tend to adopt more practices, but that trustworthiness practices tend to be neglected. Moreover, we show that the effects measured in our survey, such as team agility or accountability, can be predicted quite accurately from groups of practices. This allowed us to contrast the importance of the practices for these effects as well as adoption rates, revealing, for example, that widely adopted practices are, in reality, less important with respect to some effects. For instance, writing reusable scripts for data cleaning and merging is highly adopted, but has a limited impact on reproducibility. Overall, our study provides a quantitative assessment of ML engineering practices and their impact on desirable properties of software with ML components, by which we open multiple avenues for improving the adoption of useful practices.

Implementation options, types of interoperability and domains described in interoperability assessment models were concepts identified as directly transferable. To avoid the problems with uptake that plague the models identified, visual analytics is suggested as a vehicle for the transfer.

The objective of this systematic review of peer-reviewed studies was to assess how current food safety training programs analyzed the needs of the target audience and how those trainings were designed, developed, implemented, and evaluated. The goal was to identify training design strategies that effectively impact safe food handling behaviors of food processors. Twenty-three peer reviewed studies evaluating the impact of food safety training on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of food handlers were identified and included in this study. Twenty-two (5/23) percent of the studies reported performing a needs analysis prior to developing training, mainly to gather demographic data on the target audience. The majority of the interventions were face-to-face (83%, 19/23), followed a behaviorist framework (52%, 12/23) and lasted less than 8 h (43%, 10/23; 30%, 7/23 did not report length of training). Little information was reported on which tools were used to develop training. The evaluation design for the majority of the training programs followed an uncontrolled before and after design (65%, 15/23), 9% (2/23) were non-randomized controlled trials, and 26% (6/23) were randomized controlled trials. All of the studies included in this review evaluated one, two, or all three of the key learning outcomes, i.e., knowledge (83%, 19/23), attitudes (30%, 7/23), and behaviors (70%, 16/23). It was impossible to compare the effectiveness of the training interventions to each other due to high bias and the fact that not all were evaluated using the same methods. However, it appeared that training did have the greatest impact on knowledge and a lesser impact on attitudes and behaviors. Few studies reported performing follow-up testing to measure retention. The results of this study indicate that a systematic approach is not being taken in designing most food safety training. If food safety training programs are developed in a more systematic way, and evaluations are performed to at least Kirkpatrick Level 3, it appears there is potential for that training to become more impactful with regard to positive changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. A discussion and illustration of how training fits into the Food Safety Culture Maturity Model was provided.}

The major expected outcome in most papers was a cross-functional integration of plans, although few studies report on the integration of finance plans into S&OP. Despite the existence of common process descriptors and definitions of S&OP, there is a lack of unifying frameworks for maturity models, measurement of S&OP, and constructs related to the firm's performance. The need for additional scientifically sound survey or case study research on S&OP is emphasised. This paper contributes to a better understanding of S&OP's role as a determinant of firm's performance in the supply chain.}

Lean manufacturing (LM) has advocated gains by reducing waste and intensifying continuous improvement. As a holistic organizational policy, it must overpass the limits of the manufacturing function. Management accounting should be aligned to lean thinking, aiming to meet the demands and goals of a lean organization. This paper aims to investigate the degree of alignment between management accounting systems and LM practices.
Design/methodology/approach
Two representative case studies were carried out in industry leaders in the implementation of LM, in Brazil. The key research constructs and were identified by means of a systematic literature review. The rhetoric and practice concerning the alignment between management accounting and LM are discussed based on the existing theory and the conducted case studies.
Findings
The analysis showed that many of the principles that form the rhetoric of lean accounting are far from the accounting practices observed in the companies. Using the theory-building function of case studies, 10 propositions to be tested in future research are proposed. The main propositions are also summarized in a framework based on analogies with optical lenses.
Originality/value
To the best of the knowledge, there are no previous in-depth studies focusing on characterizing this alignment between management accounting and LM practices. The analysis yields prescriptive directions for managers that seek to improve this alignment in their business. This study also proposes a five-stage maturity model, which can be used by the managers to assess this alignment and to set goals for reaching more advanced levels of maturity.}

Whereas Industry 4.0 is still focused primarily on economic objectives to be achieved through digital transformation and automation of monotonous work processes, Industry 5.0 will also bring in social and ecological objectives. The focus is on holistic, sustainable, and human-centered value creation. Thus, the complexity of digitalization is increasing with the implementation of direct collaboration between humans and machines. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are faced with major challenges as they have limited resources for implementing a successful digitalization strategy. This makes the use of maturity models (MMs) a valuable tool for shaping the strategically aligned digitalization transition of companies. In this context, this paper reviews whether the currently existing MMs for Industry 4.0 address the specific requirements of Industry 5.0, and sufficiently consider a human-centered approach along with the assessment of readiness for disruptive technologies in companies (especially SMEs). The study examines currently existing Industry 4.0 MMs as a part of a systematic literature review. A total of 297 German- and English-language publications were found and systematically investigated, of which 24 MMs provided sufficient scientific information in the end. These were categorized using a self-developed evaluation matrix. Furthermore, they were evaluated and discussed regarding their human-centered approach and applicability to SMEs. Through the analysis, key characteristics for Industry 4.0 MMs were identified, which can serve as a basis for the development of an Industry 5.0 assessment for SMEs.}

This study aimed to review their approach to measure safety culture by the generative systematic literature review (SLR) approach. Guided by PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses), the systematic review was based on two main journal databases, namely Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), with two additional resources; Science Direct and EBSCO database. Accordingly, the search query efforts resulted in a total of twenty-nine (29) articles that could be analysed systematically. Most importantly, the review managed to formulate four main themes, namely maturity level development method, dimension identification, measurement tools, and publication categories. Overall, further analysis of the four themes resulted in the establishment of a total of 16 sub-themes. From the review, the studies found that each industry chooses different methods to develop or adapt the safety culture maturity measurement. The maturity measurement constructs had chosen to focus on specific requirements and objectives of the organisation and the worker's needs in their selections. In conclusion, systematic review in this current research study is limited and represented publications retrieved from only four databases, namely Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and EBSCO. Future studies are suggested to embark on more extensive search queries on other support databases to make further explorations on various methods involved in the SCMM development, evaluation, or applications across the industries.}

abstract = {The construction industry remains among the most hazardous sectors globally, despite significant advancements in regulatory standards over the past decades. Traditional safety management practices often rely on lagging indicators which fail to prevent future incidents or foster a proactive safety culture. Safety leading indicators, in contrast, offer a forward-looking approach by identifying risks before incidents occur. However, the effective integration of these indicators remains underexplored, with a lack of structured frameworks to guide their implementation. This research addresses this gap by developing a safety maturity framework (SMF) specifically designed for construction organizations. The SMF provides a systematic model for assessing and enhancing safety performance through five progressive stages, moving from basic compliance to advanced, data-driven practices focused on continuous improvement. Building on and extending prior maturity models that emphasize cultural evolution, the SMF explicitly incorporates leading indicators as operational benchmarks at each stage of maturity, linking organizational culture with measurable safety practices. A rigorous methodology was employed, beginning with a systematic literature review to extract safety leading indicators. This was followed by semi-structured interviews with safety professionals. Thematic and content analysis revealed key patterns, including the critical role of leadership commitment, organizational learning, and workforce engagement in embedding leading indicators into day-to-day operations. Key findings also underscored the interdependent nature of leading indicators and safety culture, demonstrating how factors like leadership and culture interact dynamically to drive safety performance. The SMF serves as a practical tool for construction firms to transition from reactive safety measures to a proactive safety culture, enhancing risk anticipation, operational efficiency, and overall sustainability. The research contributes theoretically by integrating qualitative and quantitative insights into a cohesive framework and practically by providing actionable guidance for industry professionals.}

abstract = {Digital transformation has been employed across all industries to enhance business operations. Its potential lies in optimising existing business models and creating innovative ones based on various technologies, making them fit for the future by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fulfilling future decarbonization goals. In order to ensure a successful digital transformation towards decarbonization, managers have to assess the capabilities of their organisation and competently oversee their journey by defining a clear path employing digital maturity models. For this purpose, the analysis focused on published literature concerning digital maturity models developed to guide organisations in navigating their digital transformation journey. A systematic literature review of 36 selected digital maturity models is presented in this paper. These models overlook decarbonisation measures and focus solely on demonstrating digital capabilities, efficiency and profit growth. Therefore, a maturity model for digital decarbonization encompassing dimensions of decarbonization goals, business model innovation, customers and suppliers, products and services, employees, collaboration, processes and activities, data, and IT-infrastructure, -security and -technology has been developed. It assists organisations in reducing their carbon footprint by strategically and effectively leveraging digital technologies. The proposed model has five maturity levels: assess and align, engage and refine, innovate and collaborate, optimize and personalize, and transform and decarbonize. This paper aims to assess the current level of digital decarbonization and determine the position of the organizations. Additionally, it endeavours to identify the specific opportunities for growth that digitalization presents, thereby enabling the creation of a new digital carbon-free existence.}

The Industry 4.0 paradigm represents the fourth industrial revolution, embodied by the marriage between information and communication technologies and manufacturing. Assessment campaigns are conducted to examine the status of deployment of that paradigm, mostly through self-assessment questionnaires. Each campaign is typically limited in scope, involving just a group of companies located in a few countries at most. Such limitation does not allow an overall view of Industry 4.0’s diffusion. In this paper, we offer that panoramic view through a systematic literature review. The number of papers devoted to Industry 4.0 assessment grows steadily. However, many papers do not provide essential information about the assessment campaigns they report, e.g., not detailing the number, type, or location of companies involved and the questionnaire employed. We observe a large diffusion in Europe and Asia but not in the U.S., with the Top 5 countries being Malaysia, Poland, Italy, Germany and Slovakia. The campaigns uniformly cover small, medium, and large companies but not all industrial sectors. The choice of questionnaires is extremely varied, with no standard emerging.}

abstract = {Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the ability to researchers of using design of experiments (DoE) as a structured and systematic approach to performing systematic literature reviews. The authors demonstrate a simple case study illustrating the application of DoE in executing a systematic literature review on two popular topics in higher education: academic leadership and Lean Six Sigma.
Design/methodology/approach
– The methodology involves the systematic literature review of linking academic leadership with terms such as Lean, Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, Maturity Model and Continuous Improvement. The main tool used to structure the systematic literature review is a Taguchi Orthogonal Array design, specifically an L16 grid and the method is verified by conducting another review, replacing the term academic leadership with simply leadership.
Findings
– The approach identified at first no research papers linking the terms; however, when academic leadership was replaced with university, 19 research papers where discovered. The verification exercise, linking just leadership with the other search string generated over 1,000 results – demonstrating that the tool can find large volumes of articles if they exist, the search was completed for a ten year time frame – 2004 to 2014.
Research limitations/implications
– The case study focussed on a field which is known to have little current research and the verification exercise deliberately targeted a known large body of research. The authors will continue to use the approach and refine the technique over time.
Practical implications
– This approach would help any researcher despite of their discipline to identify opportunities and gaps in the current literature.
Originality/value
– The paper shows how DoE can be used in an academic research-based process. No other literature review approach currently exists which uses Taguchi approach to DoE to filter the search criteria.}

abstract = {Objective
To systematically examine how digital health startups define and operationalize engagement in the post- coronavirus disease environment (2020-2025).
Patients and Methods
Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines adapted for web-based literature, we systematically reviewed publicly available information from digital health startups founded or significantly operating between 2020-2025. We extracted engagement definitions from company websites, white papers, blog posts, and press releases. Definitions were coded by type (explicit, implicit, or nondefinition) and dimensional focus (behavioral, cognitive, affective, and social). Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen’s κ (κ=0.82). We conducted this systematic review from April 20, 2025, to May 21, 2025.
Results
We analyzed 64 engagement definitions from 30 digital health startups. Only 18.8% (n=12) were explicit definitions with clear measurement criteria, whereas 45.3% (n=29) were implicit definitions and 35.9% (n=23) were nondefinitions that mentioned engagement without defining it. The behavioral dimension dominated (64.1%, n=41), followed by social (28.1%, n=18), cognitive (21.9%, n=14), and affective dimensions (17.2%, n=11). Statistical analysis revealed significant associations between definition type and dimensional focus (P<.05). Based on our findings, we developed a taxonomy of engagement definitions and a 5-level engagement definition maturity model.
Conclusion
Digital health startups predominantly use implicit or undefined engagement concepts with a strong behavioral focus. The proposed taxonomy and maturity model provide frameworks for standardizing engagement definitions across the digital health ecosystem, potentially improving measurement consistency, facilitating more meaningful comparisons between solutions, and establishing a baseline for evaluating effectiveness.}

This progression into the digital realm is leading to an explosion of data, and warranting advanced analytic methods to manage service systems. Known as big data analytics, these methods harness insights to deliver, serve, and enhance the customer experience in the digital marketplace. Although global economies are becoming service-oriented, little attention is paid to the role of analytics in service systems. As such, drawing on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis of 30 in-depth interviews, this study aims to understand the nature of service analytics to identify its capability dimensions. Integrating the diverse areas of research on service systems, big data and dynamic capability theories, we propose a dynamic service analytics capabilities (DSAC) framework consisting of management, technology, talent, data governance, model development, and service innovation capability. We also propose a future research agenda to advance DSAC research for the emerging service systems in the digital marketplace.}

abstract = {Purpose
One of the main challenges of organisations today is how to navigate their development into ideal sustainable organisations. However, each readiness level requires a different rubric of indicators. Therefore, this study develops a corporate sustainability maturity model (CSMM), which can be used by organisations to conduct self-assessments, identify their current sustainability maturity levels and transition into mature sustainable organisations.
Design/methodology/approach
This CSMM comprises various maturity domains, sub-domains and levels as well as a rubric of indicators for assessing the maturity of corporate sustainability. In its development, a systematic literature review examined existing maturity models, after which a pilot study, based on the literature review, content analysis and expert interviews, was used to create a prototype of the CSSM. Finally, the model was refined and expanded by considering practitioners' feedback and the tendencies of other sustainability maturity models.
Findings
On the basis of the findings, some Indonesian organisations conducted sustainability activities, without having a strategic plan. Moreover, the factors driving organisations to conduct sustainability efforts included external and internal pressure. However, typical factors, such as awareness of sustainability and organisational reputation gained from conducting sustainability activities, were insignificant in the sample.
Originality/value
This CSMM is the first sustainability maturity model developed for readiness assessment in an Indonesian context. Through this CSMM, organisations can determine their current readiness level of sustainability maturity and choose the correct indicators to help improve each sustainability domain in the matrix.}

This is a qualitative, applied research designed as an exploratory and descriptive investigation. It employs a case study to apply the intellectual capital maturity model, which is developed from the literature review. The Proknow-C method of systematic literature review is the procedure adopted for the literature review in Scopus, Science Direct and Web of Science databases. In total, 21 IC constructs were derived from such review and assessed by 18 reviewers (judges).
Findings
In the scientific literature, IC is mainly viewed as a resource or set of resources an organization for the creation of competitive advantage and value. Using the information gathered about different views on IC, this study proposes a construction of the theoretical model, based on the models of the capability maturity model–Software Engineering Institute and Asian Productivity Organization–Knowledge Management, the management model and the application protocol.
Practical implications
This research offers view on the nature of the concept of IC showing (IC) as a business asset through maturity scale. The analysis of the concept of IC is focused at organizational and dimensional levels.
Originality/value
This study contributes to the further development of the concept of IC regarding its measurement in organizations through the maturity scale.}

The principal contribution of this study is that the model links a customer analytics perspective to a resource-based view (RBV)-capability of the retailers by proposing six customer analytics capability dimensions and twelve sub-dimensions in the spectrum of market orientation and technology orientation. The customer analytics capability dimensions depict three crucial themes of marketing, such as value creation (offering capability and personalization capability), value delivery (distribution capability and communication capability), and value management (data management capability and data protection capability). By incorporating this capability dimensions, practitioners will likely be able to engage customers and enhance customer equity.}

While microalgae-based production systems have garnered significant scientific interest, their techno-economic-environmental viability is still challenged by many limitations. Key research questions emerge: What are the prospects for scaling up microalgae-based production systems? Can microalgal bioproducts achieve true sustainability? This study aims to respond with a systematic meta-review of recent literature containing economic and environmental scientific information. A narrative synthesis is combined with data collection, homogenisation, and appraisal to provide a synoptic framework that captures the latest trends from techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment, identifying enablers and barriers within a future perspective. The analysis of production costs and GHG emissions reveals a general tendency of poor performance and competitiveness of microalgal bioproducts. However, several optimistic estimates are found within a broad variability of results. Promising strategies are the valorisation of waste streams and the implementation of multi-product biorefinery models, in line with circular bioeconomy and zero-waste principles. The adoption of low-carbon energy technologies and the direct exploitation of sunlight present a additional opportunities to abate GHG emissions. Further potential lies in incentivising pilot projects, which are essential in accelerating process maturity. From a holistic perspective, advancing sustainability will require addressing the social dimension and multi-criteria optimisation. On the other hand, legislative barriers and customer acceptability must be managed through the interaction of academia, industry, and policymakers. Such efforts are crucial to unlock microalgae’s full potential and support the microalgal industry's real-world applicability, striving to achieve enhanced market penetration through green and cost-effective production processes.}

Our study aims to build and empirically validate an Industry 4.0 digital maturity model, based on the Technology-Organization-Environment framework. We conducted a systematic literature review of 55 digital maturity models, which we synthesized to create an integrated digital maturity assessment model. We tested our model through a focus group with industry experts and 24 companies from various manufacturing sectors. Our review suggests that existing digital maturity models have underestimated the relevance of the Environment dimension. Our empirical data suggests that companies often invest in digital technologies without considering critical organizational and environmental constraints.}

This paper aims to explore how purchasing could respond to disruptive technologies by examining the assumptions underlying purchasing strategic alignment and purchasing maturity through a contingency lens.
Design/methodology/approach
This study uses a systematic review across purchasing maturity and purchasing strategic alignment literature. This is supplemented with exploratory case studies to include practitioners’ views.
Findings
This research demonstrates that neither purchasing maturity nor purchasing strategic alignment are suitable approaches to respond to disruptive technologies. Purchasing maturity does not allow purchasing managers to select relevant practices. It also shows no consideration of any contingencies, which practitioners highlight as important for the selection of practices. Purchasing strategic alignment includes the company strategy as a contingency but does not provide any practices to choose from. It does not include any other contextual contingencies considered important by practitioners. The findings indicate that linking the two research streams may provide a more suitable approach to responding to disruptive technologies.
Research limitations/implications
This research demonstrates the requirement to develop a new approach to responding to disruptive technologies, by linking purchasing maturity and purchasing strategic alignment to contextual contingencies. This is a currently unexplored approach in academic literature, which refutes the generally accepted premise that higher maturity unilaterally supports a better positioning towards technological disruption. This research also highlights a requirement for practitioners to shift their approach to “best practices”.
Originality/value
This is the first research to systematically review the relationships between purchasing maturity and purchasing strategic alignment. It adds to contingency theory by suggesting that purchasing maturity models can support the achievement of strategic alignment. Also, future research directions are suggested to explore these relationships.}

abstract = {The emergence of advanced digital tools such as building information modelling (BIM) has transformed the concept of building management in the construction sector. Despite the promising benefits of BIM in terms of successful project deliveries and enhanced building performance, construction firms struggle to view assets from the perspective of a whole asset life cycle context, and consequently struggle to derive their full potentials via BIM, especially in the operations and maintenance (O&M) phase. One of the fundamental reasons behind this challenge is the lack of empirical understanding of what information should be collected to support efficient and effective operation and maintenance management. Various BIM capability maturity models have been proposed to support BIM integrations into O&M management, but most of these models fail to capture detailed information requirements (IRs). Furthermore, there is limited insights regarding the prioritisations of these IRs to guide construction firms and asset owners towards operational competitiveness and excellence. To address these gaps, this study aims to develop a BIM and O&M maturity assessment model (BIM and O&M MM) by drawing on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI) concept, and utilising Delphi technique and maturity grids. The developed tool enables asset owners and managers to assess BIM and O&M integration maturity of built assets, based on a five-level maturity scheme across 21 IRs. To ensure effectiveness and practicality of the tool, 22 experts assessed the tool, and the results indicate its ability to succinctly measure the maturity level of BIM and O&M integration, thereby enabling construction managers and asset owners to identify areas of strengths and deficiencies for prioritising capital investments. The BIM and O&M MM ensures stakeholder alignment and addresses real-world O&M challenges. It enhances data consistency, optimised long-term asset management, data-driven decision-making, and provides a foundation for future research and technology integration.}
