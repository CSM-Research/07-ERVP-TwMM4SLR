	abstract = {The purpose of Maturity Models (MMs) is to assess, by focusing on skills, the level of performance of organizations, projects, or processes. In the civil construction sector, MMs were investigated with a view to evaluating the integration of sustainability in single/multifamily housebuilding projects. However, these models were found to be insufficient to evaluate projects in a balanced way, which take the three pillars of sustainability into consideration throughout their life cycle. In addition, there was a need to incorporate the evaluation of technical elements, thereby enabling opportunities to be identified for improving technologies, information systems and materials, which would result in maximizing operational efficiency. In this context, this article presents a management tool to evaluate the performance of sustainability in single/multifamily building projects. Using a mixed methods research approach, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the main sustainable practices adopted in civil construction. Based on this, the Sustainable Building Site Management Maturity Model (SBSM4) was developed, which underwent refinements using a consultation process with six experts, using the Delphi method. It encompasses 4 dimensions, 16 categories and 61 assessment attributes, covering the planning, design, construction, and post-construction stages. An application was carried out in a project that aimed to build 5,000 single-family houses. This tool can perform a complete analysis of the practices adopted, thus providing a deeper understanding of the level of sustainability achieved. The SBSM4 contributes to advancing sustainable management in the civil construction sector and provides a solid basis for decision-making and the continuous improvement of projects toward more sustainable civil construction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The increasing adoption of industrialized offsite construction (IOC) offers substantial benefits in efficiency, quality, and sustainability, yet presents persistent challenges related to data fragmentation, real-time monitoring, and coordination. This systematic review investigates the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced digital twins (DTs) in addressing these challenges within IOC. Employing a hybrid re-view methodology—combining scientometric mapping and qualitative content analysis—52 relevant studies were analyzed to identify technological trends, implementation barriers, and emerging research themes. The findings reveal that AI-driven DTs enable dynamic scheduling, predictive maintenance, real-time quality control, and sustainable lifecycle management across all IOC phases. Seven thematic application clusters are identified, including logistics optimization, safety management, and data interoperability, supported by a layered architectural framework and key enabling technologies. This study contributes to the literature by providing an early synthesis that integrates technical, organizational, and strategic dimensions of AI-driven DT implementation in IOC context. It distinguishes DT applications in IOC from those in onsite construction and expands AI’s role beyond conventional data analytics toward agentive, autonomous decision-making. The proposed future research agenda offers strategic directions such as the development of DT maturity models, lifecycle-spanning integration strategies, scalable AI agent systems, and cost-effective DT solutions for small and medium enterprises. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: To systematically examine how digital health startups define and operationalize engagement in the post- coronavirus disease environment (2020-2025). Patients and Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines adapted for web-based literature, we systematically reviewed publicly available information from digital health startups founded or significantly operating between 2020-2025. We extracted engagement definitions from company websites, white papers, blog posts, and press releases. Definitions were coded by type (explicit, implicit, or nondefinition) and dimensional focus (behavioral, cognitive, affective, and social). Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen's κ (κ=0.82). We conducted this systematic review from April 20, 2025, to May 21, 2025. Results: We analyzed 64 engagement definitions from 30 digital health startups. Only 18.8% (n=12) were explicit definitions with clear measurement criteria, whereas 45.3% (n=29) were implicit definitions and 35.9% (n=23) were nondefinitions that mentioned engagement without defining it. The behavioral dimension dominated (64.1%, n=41), followed by social (28.1%, n=18), cognitive (21.9%, n=14), and affective dimensions (17.2%, n=11). Statistical analysis revealed significant associations between definition type and dimensional focus (P<.05). Based on our findings, we developed a taxonomy of engagement definitions and a 5-level engagement definition maturity model. Conclusion: Digital health startups predominantly use implicit or undefined engagement concepts with a strong behavioral focus. The proposed taxonomy and maturity model provide frameworks for standardizing engagement definitions across the digital health ecosystem, potentially improving measurement consistency, facilitating more meaningful comparisons between solutions, and establishing a baseline for evaluating effectiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Information security governance in the public sector involves risk management, accountability frameworks, network security, e-government systems infrastructure, mitigation plans, and alignment with corporate strategy. It equips organizations with the ability to deal with the security of their vital information assets systematically. However, several recent hacking incidents reveal the fact that substandard governance processes are among the common causes of weak security measures in most organizations. This study has been conducted following the established protocol outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Systematic Mapping Review (SMR) initially identified 1496 papers, and this reviews and reports on 41 papers. The reviewed literature emphasizes the adherence to recognized governance standard frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27,001, EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and EU Network and Information Security Act (NIS) for providing effective information security guidance frameworks in the public sector. However, a general scarcity is found regarding the best practices followed in the area of information security compliance. There is a lack of employing key performance indicators, risk assessment measures, security maturity models in organizations, and compliance audits. Additionally, the study suggests that, to some extent, the adoption of appropriate information security governance procedures is linked with available budgeted resources for individual organizations. The study results can serve as a starting point for the research and practitioners’ community in the area of information security governance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The growing complexity and demands for high-quality software underlined the need for robust automated software testing frameworks. However, lack of skilled personnel, cost of testing automation, and maintenance of script along with others oppose the widespread adoption of automation in testing. The work proposed by this study is in line with the development of Systematic Process Improvement Model for Testing Automation, abbreviated as SPIM-TA. The model is inspired from Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Software Outsourcing Vendor Readiness Model (SOVRM) maturity-level-based framework. The research was done based on a four-phased methodology. In the first phase, a systematic literature review identified 14 critical challenges in software testing automation with practices or solutions for each of these challenges. In the second round, a survey questionnaire is used to validate these findings in industrial context and extract more practical insights from case studies. This dual approach had ensured both academic rigor and the relevance of the practices with industry. The third one involved developing SPIM-TA by incorporating insights that come from the SLR and those results of the survey as well. The framework defines five maturity levels, systematically addressing the identified challenges and providing a structured pathway for organizations to enhance their automation processes. In the fourth phase, case studies of industrial applications were carried out to evaluate SPIM-TA's efficiency. The applicability, scalability, and impact of the framework on testing automation in the real world were assessed using the Motorola Assessment Tool. The findings illustrate the systematic way SPIM-TA will help overcome the automation challenge, so that organizations can reach more advanced levels of maturity and efficiency in their testing processes. In the first place, the present study closes the gap between academia and industry but at the same time paves the foundation for future research into the automation of software testing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is in constant development, has impacted various spheres of society, profoundly reshaping how organizations conduct their business and bringing significant challenges. Understanding the applications and maturity levels of AI technologies is crucial for organizations seeking to harness the full potential of these innovations. The systematic literature review (SLR) revealed that while there are some models for stages of AI application, none have been specifically adapted and evaluated for the facilities management (FM) environment. FM is an operations area responsible for integrating people, spaces, processes, and technologies in built environments, aiming for optimal functionality throughout the life cycle. Additionally, the SLR revealed that AI applications in FM often rely on legacy platforms such as supervisory control and data acquisition for building maintenance activities and building information modeling for construction, as a form of adaptive technologies. Given this gap and the importance of this sector to companies, it is essential to identify which AI technologies are used and at what stages they are. The results indicated various potential AI applications in FM, which can present different maturity stages, underscoring the need for adapted models so that managers can categorize and subsequently direct managerial efforts in pursuit of operational excellence. The goal is to provide organizations with practical and adaptable insights to assess, enhance, and optimize AI applications, thereby increasing efficiency, productivity, and innovation in their operations. From an academic perspective, the study aims to fill the research gap on AI typologies and maturity levels in the context of FM, contributing to the advancement of FM theory. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Underground infrastructure, designed to last for decades, play a vital role in urban life. Its maintenance and upkeep have significant societal values and contribute to sustainability. Simulation and modelling along with digitisation and virtualisation as key technologies in the context of Industry 4.0 have fundamentally transformed delivery of engineering projects. With climate change pose pressing challenges on the physical environment of human dwelling, infrastructure resilience has been strategised as a sustainable development goal. Inception of Industry 5.0 has been formulated surrounding this need incentivising to build and maintain with sustainability, resilience and human-centric as core values. Digital twin (DT) paradigm facilitated by a series of cross-disciplinary technologies has emerged to play a role toward these targets. Along with data management and artificial intelligence (AI), DTs present transforming potentials from a technology-focus approach to a value-focus approach. This paper conducts a systematic review on generation and applications of DTs for underground infrastructure maintenance, highlighting the multi-physics, multi-scale, and interdisciplinary characteristics of underground infrastructure. After examining challenges and opportunities for underground infrastructure, and thoroughly reviewing the existing definitions and maturity levels of DT in Section 1, a DT framework for maintenance is established under the “Descriptive-Reflective-Predictive-Prescriptive” maturity model featuring progressive function requirements, forming Section 2-5 of the paper. Section 2 focuses on reviewing information modelling techniques for creating a descriptive twin, essentially answering the question of “what is it”. Section 3 explores sensing technologies and data-driven analytics to develop a reflective twin, addressing applications requiring the knowledge of “what is happening”. Section 4 examines methods of deterioration modelling and multi-physics simulations to establish a predictive twin, providing insights into “what will happen”. Section 5 investigates approaches to intervention decision-making through service-oriented and multi-criteria frameworks, providing outlook into a prescriptive twin that addresses “what should be done”. Finally, a brief summary and some prospects requiring further investigations are presented. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In an era marked by relentless technological shifts and market volatility, digital transformation (DT) alone is insufficient. Organizations must develop Resilient Digital Transformation (RDT)—the organizational capabilities required to sustain DT over a medium-term horizon—to navigate these challenges effectively. This study primarily aims to propose a guideline for fostering RDT. Drawing on the PRISMA guidelines and a systematic review of 77 peer-reviewed papers, this study identifies and synthesizes key targets and drivers across three core pillars: Technology, Organization, and External Environment. These elements collectively foster organizational resilience. Specifically, this study highlights how adaptability, innovation, and scalability form the technological underpinnings of sustained digital maturity; meanwhile, effective governance frameworks, ongoing workforce development, and supportive cultures promote organizational agility. Externally, proactive stakeholder engagement, responsiveness to market shifts, and robust regulatory compliance help ensure the long-term viability of digital initiatives. The findings contribute to the existing literature by unifying an integrative framework illustrating how organizations can sense, seize, and reconfigure resources to embed resilience across strategic and operational processes.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the critical need to incorporate Circular Economy principles into supply chain management for decoupling economic growth and resource consumption. Circular supply chains, characterized by their restorative and regenerative nature, inherently introduce operational complexities. Concurrently, hyperconnectivity is evolving as a pervasive reality, defined by the extensive and intricate interconnectedness among actors across multiple layers. Specifically, we investigate the potential of the Physical Internet, a hyperconnected global logistics system, to facilitate the implementation of circular supply chains. Our approach includes a systematic literature review to map the current landscape and the development of a novel conceptual framework. This framework, merging the Physical Internet and circular supply chain concepts, identifies ten interrelated characteristics from various aspects such as product design, production, logistics, supply chain asset utilization, product usage, recovery, performance monitoring, material and energy exchange, as well as technology and business model innovation. Additionally, we introduce a four-stage maturity model to evaluate and improve companies' circular supply chain practices systematically. Its practical application is illustrated through two cases in automobile and sport garment industry respectively. This study is among the first to explore the integration of hyperconnectivity in logistics management into implementing circular supply chains. It lays a theoretical foundation and suggests actionable strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Among different RE phases include, requirements elicitation, requirements analysis, requirements specification, requirements validation, and requirements management. There is essential need of an assessment model where software organization can measure their level of capability to implement requirements engineering. Besides so much advances in this field, there is no such assessment model where organizations can find their level of maturity towards requirements engineering process. In this research, requirements engineering model (REM) is designed and implemented via case studies from different software organizations. For designing REM, literature review of different models was conducted, and levels of REM were finalized. In the first phase, success factors of successful software requirements implementation were identified via systematic literature review (SLR). Furthermore, the identified CSFs are organized into five levels based on Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Software Outsourcing Vendors' Readiness Model (SOVRM). Using Motorola assessment technique, REM was evaluated via case studies from different software organizations. As a result of SLR, total of 50 success factors from different phases of requirements engineering were identified from 191 papers and then mapped to five levels of REM. Three case studies were conducted from different companies to evaluate REM. The outcome analysis of case studies shows that different organizations are on different maturity levels of requirements implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research paper investigates the integration of sustainable performance metrics into digital maturity models specifically tailored for small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs), which represent a significant pillar of the Canadian economy. Despite their economic importance, SMMEs face increasing challenges in adopting digital technologies while ensuring sustainable performance. However, traditional digital maturity models often fail to capture the economic, social, and environmental impacts of digital transformation, creating a gap in assessing sustainability within this transition. This study aims to bridge this gap by proposing a framework that integrates sustainable performance indicators into existing digital maturity models. Through a systematic literature review, this study categorises indicators into three main dimensions—economic, social, and environmental—addressing aspects such as resource efficiency, employee well-being, and ecological impact. The proposed framework enables SMMEs to evaluate both their digital maturity and its impact on sustainable performance dimensions. By aligning these metrics with digital maturity assessment, this framework enhances decision-making for SMEs aiming to balance technological adoption with sustainability goals. Furthermore, the study consolidates key performance indicators relevant to SMMEs, providing a structured approach to assess the intersection of digital maturity and sustainability. The results emphasise the importance of incorporating sustainability dimensions into digital transformation strategies, offering SMMEs a structured framework to better access the relationship between digital maturity and sustainable performance while maintaining competitiveness in the digital economy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The successful deployment of machine learning (ML) models in production environments remains a significant challenge despite advancements in ML algorithms and model development. MLOps, a set of practices that combines machine learning and DevOps principles, has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge. This paper presents a meta-synthesis of systematic reviews to provide a comprehensive understanding of MLOps practices, tools, and challenges for effective ML model deployment. The meta-synthesis was conducted following Chrastina’s [1] methodology and included three systematic reviews and one review of MLOps products and providers. The meta-synthesis identified key MLOps principles, such as automation, reproducibility, collaboration, continuous learning, and data governance. It also revealed the main stages of the MLOps workflow, including data collection and processing, model development and training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining. Various frameworks and architectures that facilitate MLOps implementation were discussed, such as open-source platforms, cloud computing platforms, containerization, and container orchestration. The study highlighted the main features offered by MLOps tools, including automation, experiment tracking, versioning, monitoring, and model deployment. The most common methods of deploying ML models in production environments were identified as the use of container technologies, cloud platforms and services, and deployment of models as web services. The meta-synthesis also discussed the importance of adapted software development maturity models for assessing the maturity level of MLOps processes in organizations. Furthermore, the paper emphasized the critical roles and responsibilities involved in ML model operationalization activities, such as data scientists, data engineers, DevOps engineers, and domain experts. The main challenges encountered when deploying ML models in production environments were discussed, including managing the model lifecycle, ensuring scalability and performance, monitoring and maintaining models in real-world conditions. Open issues and challenges in MLOps were also identified, such as the need to develop standards and best practices, ensure interpretability and responsible use of models, and effectively manage data. The findings of this meta-synthesis can guide organizations in adopting MLOps practices to improve the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of their ML model deployments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Digital sustainable maturity (DSM) is an important factor for gaining a competitive advantage. However, the literature on this topic is scarce. This study was designed to understand and formalize the concept of DSM and investigate models for measuring it in the context of supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) tool, whose steps and evaluation criteria resulted in a portfolio of 87 articles. These were analyzed based on pre-established criteria from the literature on scope, design and application. Findings: The results revealed an emerging field, but with the domain of DSM still underexplored. No formal concept of DSM was found in the literature. Thus, this paper presents the first definition in the field, which can be understood as the organization’s dynamic capability to leverage its digital assets to promote sustainable performance in economic, environmental and social dimensions. Regarding the analyzed models, 72 maturity models were identified considering both domains. However, only nine of them provided a model for evaluating DSM. Overall, the models presented varied architectures, which made it impossible to determine a consistent approach for measuring maturity in this domain. Originality/value: This study is original as it systematically integrated digital and sustainable constructs to measure maturity. Furthermore, it formalizes the concept of DSM, which was not found in the existing literature. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Macroergonomics aims to create entirely “harmonious” work systems that increase many areas of organisational efficiency and effectiveness. In macroergonomics, all work system components must collaborate to ensure safety. As a result, while the previous SLR only examined validity and reliability, a study of measurement variables is required to create an SCMM measuring instrument utilising a macroergonomic method. This project will conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of SCMM publishing papers during the last 22 years (2001–2023). This SLR tries to classify the variables used in SCMM measurement into sociotechnical (macroergonomic) work subsystems, study fields, models, and measurement methods. This paper applied the SLR methodology to 53 SCMM articles in the last two decades, from 2001 to 2023. Data was collected by searching for published articles in Scopus, Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar, UK. Health and Safety Executive (HSE), ProQuest and Occupational Safety and Health Resource based on article title, abstract and keywords. Filtering was done by using keywords and evaluating the content's suitability by examining the article’s abstract and overall content (Output 53 articles). The results found valuable gaps in the use of the five sociotechnical work subsystems in measuring performance. The SLR found 18 organisation variables, 3 job and task variables, 7 human variables, 5 environmental variables and 7 tools and technological variables. The results indicate that the primary research areas in SCMM are health care and oil and gas, with ten publications. Besides, the SLR results indicated that the Hudson Model was the most utilised method, and the most used method was a questionnaire. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

DevOps practices still need to be mature, and practitioners face numerous challenges while considering DevOps as a software development process. The mainstream research community has helped simplify the DevOps adoption process and eliminate complexities by developing DevOps maturity models. However, the current maturity frameworks cannot measure every component of DevOps and do not mention metrics as parameters for measuring different DevOps practices or features. Therefore, this study aims to identify metrics for measuring practices and activities responsible for DevOps implementation. The systematic literature review (SLR) method was used to determine the metrics needed to measure DevOps practices. Using SLR, we have identified 32 metrics from 57 articles. The metrics identified in this study can be used to measure the impact of the practices adopted for DevOps implementation within software development organizations. Furthermore, we divided the identified metrics into Dev and Ops categories and five significant categories based on the DevOps lifecycle. The classification of metrics in our study into diverse regions provides a conceptual framework and understanding of DevOps measures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose Blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and zero-trust cybersecurity share a common element: trust. This study aims to present an original exploration of the potential symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain technologies, focusing on how they can enhance each other’s capabilities to promote zero-trust cybersecurity within an evolving information environment. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a scoping review of the existing literature in the Web of Science database, following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). These guidelines informed our methodological approach to searching for articles, screening them and determining inclusion and exclusion criteria. This investigation focused on IEEE-affiliated publications that demonstrate how blockchain can benefit AI and vice versa, as well as the causal interconnections between AI and blockchain in the context of zero-trust cybersecurity. To extract information for content analysis and causal mapping, the authors used the zero-trust pillars from the zero-trust maturity model as a theory-driven coding framework. Findings The results indicate ten ways that blockchain can benefit if AI were identified, including data anonymization, secure data sharing, transaction traceability, decentralized storage to mitigate data loss, data immutability, reduced opportunities for data fraud, controlled access and trading of models, clear and permanent result distribution, increased perceived security and support for AI-moderated exchanges. Conversely, the authors highlight nine ways AI can benefit blockchain: controlled data editing, network access management, parameter determination, behavioral profiling to detect inconsistencies or fraud, taxonomy creation for potential attacks, anomaly detection in data sets, development of new consensus mechanisms, building applications on existing infrastructures and content personalization while preserving privacy. Practical implications The synergistic combination of AI and blockchain technologies complementarily bolsters zero-trust security across industries, leading to more effective cybersecurity strategies. Although multiple zero-trust pillars have been addressed, further research is needed to tackle challenges associated with the cross-cutting capabilities, specifically the orchestration, visibility and analytics and governance pillars. The research findings demonstrate the practical value of integrating AI and blockchain to promote a trustworthy cyberspace for current developers of cybersecurity solutions. Originality/value The primary originality of this study lies in uncovering the reciprocal relationship between AI and blockchain technology, coupled with the novel integration of a scoping review with causal mapping. This AI-blockchain synergy enhances data and information security within zero-trust frameworks, ultimately strengthening cyber resilience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the sustainability maturity of procurement processes in a public educational institution in Brazil. It also aims to assess the extent to which sustainability criteria are integrated into procurement decisions and identify patterns that influence sustainability maturity levels. By analyzing the procurement data, this study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for advancing sustainability in public procurement. Design/methodology/approach The research follows a structured four-step methodology. First, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA protocol identified sustainability criteria and guided the development of the sustainable maturity model. Second, procurement documents from January to December 2024 were collected and analyzed. Third, content analysis categorized sustainability criteria within the procurement processes. Finally, statistical analysis examined patterns and associations between variables. This mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques, ensured a comprehensive evaluation of sustainability maturity levels within procurement activities. Findings Results indicate that most procurement processes exhibit a basic level of sustainability maturity (Level 1), with many lacking key sustainability criteria. Material procurement demonstrated a higher level of integration of sustainability, facilitated by standardized guidelines, such as Brazil’s National Guide for Sustainable Procurement. However, customized criteria demonstrated greater sustainability maturity, emphasizing the need for context-specific adaptations. The most common criteria were compliance with legislation, working conditions and risk management, driven by regulatory obligations. Advanced environmental criteria, such as waste management and product life cycle, were rarely applied. Additionally, social and governance-related aspects were underrepresented, highlighting gaps in holistic sustainability adoption. Research limitations/implications This study focuses on a single public educational institution, which limits the generalizability of its findings. The analysis is restricted to procurement documents from 2024, which may not capture long-term trends. Additionally, the study primarily relies on document analysis, which may potentially exclude informal sustainability practices. Future research should expand to include multiple institutions and explore computational tools to automate sustainability assessments. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into sustainability maturity in procurement, serving as a foundation for further investigations on how public procurement can contribute to broader sustainability goals. Practical implications The findings highlight the need for public institutions to enhance sustainability integration in procurement processes. While standardized guidelines facilitate basic sustainability adoption, customized criteria demonstrate a higher level of maturity, suggesting the importance of institutional flexibility. The study underscores the need for training procurement professionals on sustainability practices and improving monitoring mechanisms. Policymakers can use these insights to refine procurement policies, ensuring a stronger alignment with sustainability goals. Enhancing sustainability maturity in procurement can lead to more responsible resource use, better risk management, and greater alignment with national and international sustainability frameworks. Social implications Sustainable procurement plays a crucial role in promoting social responsibility and equitable development. This study reveals gaps in the adoption of social and governance-related criteria, highlighting the need for policies that strengthen labor rights, ethical sourcing, and supplier diversity. By incorporating broader dimensions of social sustainability, public procurement can improve working conditions and reduce inequalities. The findings support the argument that procurement can be leveraged as a tool for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly those related to decent work, responsible consumption, and institutional transparency. Originality/value This study provides a novel contribution by assessing sustainability maturity in public procurement using a structured methodology. It bridges the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical applications, offering a model that can be adapted across institutions. The research highlights the role of customized sustainability criteria in enhancing maturity levels, which has been underexplored in previous studies. By identifying gaps in the adoption of social and environmental criteria, the study provides actionable insights for improving procurement strategies. The findings reinforce the strategic importance of procurement in advancing sustainability, particularly within public institutions committed to the 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the Password Security Education Maturity Model (PSEMM), a comprehensive framework designed to guide organizations in systematically improving their password security practices through a structured progression of educational and operational stages. The model delineates five levels of maturity, Naivety, Foundational Awareness, Active Engagement, Embedded Security Habits, and Adaptive Security Mindset each representing a step forward in the development of robust password security protocols and a culture of security awareness. The development of the PSEMM is grounded in a systematic literature review (SLR) that identified 989 articles that were then screened for inclusion eligibility, which eventually resulted in 12 articles being used to identify key themes and gaps in existing cybersecurity education models. Through this rigorous analysis, the study pinpointed the need for a specialized maturity model that not only addresses the technical aspects of password management but also emphasizes the critical role of continuous education and employee engagement. The PSEMM fills this gap by offering a clear, adaptable pathway for organizations of varying sizes and sectors to enhance their cybersecurity posture. The model’s applicability is demonstrated through its alignment with modern security practices, such as multi-factor authentication and password management tools, ensuring its relevance in today’s rapidly evolving digital terrain. This paper contributes to the field of cybersecurity education by providing a validated, practical tool for systematically advancing password security across organizational contexts. The PSEMM stands as a vital resource for organizations seeking to mitigate the risks associated with poor password practices, ultimately fostering a more resilient cybersecurity environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While microalgae-based production systems have garnered significant scientific interest, their techno-economic-environmental viability is still challenged by many limitations. Key research questions emerge: What are the prospects for scaling up microalgae-based production systems? Can microalgal bioproducts achieve true sustainability? This study aims to respond with a systematic meta-review of recent literature containing economic and environmental scientific information. A narrative synthesis is combined with data collection, homogenisation, and appraisal to provide a synoptic framework that captures the latest trends from techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment, identifying enablers and barriers within a future perspective. The analysis of production costs and GHG emissions reveals a general tendency of poor performance and competitiveness of microalgal bioproducts. However, several optimistic estimates are found within a broad variability of results. Promising strategies are the valorisation of waste streams and the implementation of multi-product biorefinery models, in line with circular bioeconomy and zero-waste principles. The adoption of low-carbon energy technologies and the direct exploitation of sunlight present a additional opportunities to abate GHG emissions. Further potential lies in incentivising pilot projects, which are essential in accelerating process maturity. From a holistic perspective, advancing sustainability will require addressing the social dimension and multi-criteria optimisation. On the other hand, legislative barriers and customer acceptability must be managed through the interaction of academia, industry, and policymakers. Such efforts are crucial to unlock microalgae's full potential and support the microalgal industry's real-world applicability, striving to achieve enhanced market penetration through green and cost-effective production processes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The manufacturing industry is characterized by challenges including global competitiveness, unpredictable market evolutions, lack of skills, and supply chain disruptions. To gain competitiveness, manufacturing Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) shall pursue Digital Transformation (DT) which enables significant benefits such as operational excellence and long-term business sustainability. However, SMEs usually struggle to successfully implement DT due to several impediments like lack of consistency between business strategy and digital plans, internal cultural resistance, and limited resources. Thus, the present research aims to develop a roadmapping methodology that supports manufacturing SMEs to define and implement a structured DT plan. The authors first investigate the SMEs-tailored existing tools, their role, and their limits through a systematic literature review: detailing existing Maturity Models (MMs) and digital roadmapping approaches and evaluating how they intertwined. Today, digital roadmapping methodologies neglect some SME’s barriers, appearing as too generic and more adequate for large companies. They do not provide pragmatic support to ensure the strategic alignment between digital initiatives and corporate goals, as well as they do not offer practical guidelines to select and prioritize actions. To fill this gap, the authors conjectured a roadmapping methodology tailored on SMEs’ challenges. Three maps are elaborated to determine market, business, and strategic targets, and to assess their consistency with the identified digital initiatives. Furthermore, a methodological approach is provided to support SMEs during the evaluation of effort and benefits. The methodology was validated through application cases involving Italian manufacturing SMEs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Unlike traditional models that rely on predefined Key Process Areas (KPAs), SAMAM adopts 14 critical barriers (CBs) identified through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and corresponding practices as the foundation for its maturity levels. The study was conducted in four phases. First, an SLR was performed to identify 14 critical barriers to XP adoption and their respective mitigation practices. In the second phase, a survey questionnaire was administered within the software industry to validate the SLR findings and extract additional industry-relevant practices. The third phase involved the development of SAMAM, structured into five maturity levels using the identified barriers and practices instead of traditional KPAs. In the final phase, industrial case studies were conducted to evaluate the model’s effectiveness in real-world settings using the Motorola Assessment Tool. The findings demonstrate that SAMAM provides a comprehensive and scalable approach to assess and improve XP adoption maturity by systematically addressing critical adoption barriers. The model supports organizations in overcoming XP adoption challenges and achieving higher process maturity. The evaluation through case studies confirmed the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model, contributing to the body of knowledge on agile methodologies and advancing XP adoption in the software development industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, analysing 49 peer-reviewed articles (2020–2024) from the Scopus database. The review uniquely combined three theoretical lenses – the digital maturity model, Industry 4.0 framework, and dynamic capabilities theory – to understand the DT-OR relationship in large enterprises. The findings reveal three critical pathways through which DT enhances OR: operational flexibility (40–50% improvement), data-driven decision-making (30–35%), and stakeholder engagement (25–30%). Counter to traditional assumptions, knowledge management systems amplify DT’s impact on OR by 1.5–2 times, suggesting organisational learning capabilities are more crucial than technological sophistication. The proposed framework introduces continuous feedback loops and evaluation mechanisms, offering a structured yet flexible approach for navigating DT complexities in large enterprises. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital health has become integral to public health care, advancing how services are accessed, delivered, and managed. Health organizations increasingly assess their digital health maturity to leverage these innovations fully. However, existing digital health maturity models (DHMMs) primarily focus on technology and infrastructure, often neglecting critical communication components. Objective: This systematic review addresses gaps in DHMMs by identifying deficiencies in user communication elements and proposing the digital health communication maturity model (DHCMM). The DHCMM integrates critical health communication dimensions such as satisfaction, engagement, personalization, and customization to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework. Methods: We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to conduct a systematic review of studies selected from 3 databases: EBSCO, PubMed, and ProQuest. Studies were screened and included based on their focus on digital health maturity and communication elements, with the final selection limited to English-language research addressing DHMMs. Results: Of the 1138 initially identified studies, 31 (2.72%) met the inclusion criteria. Current DHMMs heavily emphasize infrastructure while overlooking user engagement and communication; for instance, only 35% (11/31) of the reviewed models incorporated user satisfaction, and less than one-fifth (6/31, 19%) addressed personalization or customization. The DHCMM addresses these gaps with 7 maturity levels, ranging from initial to engaged, and emphasizes user-centered metrics and governance. Quantitative analysis showed substantial variations in communication metrics, with satisfaction metrics incorporated at an average rate of 22% (7/31) across the reviewed models. Conclusions: The DHCMM shifts the focus of digital health maturity assessments by emphasizing communication and user engagement. This model provides health care organizations with a structured framework to enhance digital health initiatives, leading to better patient outcomes and system-wide efficiencies. The model delivers actionable insights for organizations aiming to achieve advanced digital maturity by addressing underrepresented dimensions. Future research should implement and refine the DHCMM across diverse health care contexts to enhance its effectiveness. The adoption of this model could result in more equitable, user-centered health care systems that integrate technological advancements with human-centered care. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology, a transformative force in digital transactions, has emerged as a significant enabler of secure, transparent, and traceable operations within supply chain management and logistics (SCML). Its immutable nature facilitates enhanced management of SCML activities by seamlessly integrating information flow throughout the value chain, and substantially increasing data integrity and operational reliability. While organizations are attracted to these capabilities, they still lack comprehensive guidelines to fully benefit from blockchain in SCML. There is a fundamental need to assist organizations in assessing and enhancing their blockchain-based SCML capabilities. Maturity models (MMs) are tools that help organizations assess and improve their processes, providing step-by-step guidelines from basic to advanced levels of maturity. Therefore, this study aims to identify and analyze MMs focused on blockchain-based SCML. An extensive systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted, and thirteen relevant studies were identified and evaluated against a comprehensive set of quality criteria. The analysis revealed that none of the existing MMs fully satisfied all criteria, highlighting a significant gap in the field. This research provides a thorough systematic analysis of MMs for blockchain-based SCML, offering an in-depth view of their levels, dimensions, research focuses, domains, industry targets, and their quality evaluation. The significance of this study lies in identifying the necessity for an MM specifically designed for blockchain-based SCML, addressing a critical gap in the current literature. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on blockchain integration in SCML and provide a foundation for future research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

For organizations, projects are a central element for generating value. They allow to reach the organizational goal by using specific methodologies, tools and software. One of the most recognized tools, even in other fields of knowledge, for its impact on process improvement is maturity models. These models have already begun to be implemented in project management. Project management maturity models are useful tools to evaluate the management process using a process reference (e.g., PMBOK). This process reference describes the best practices to achieve success in projects. The purpose of this paper is the identification of research papers that present maturity models specifically for project management. A useful classification for project managers using maturity models in a project management context is generated from the results of the review. The proposed classification considers 4 categories: (1) project management, (2) organizational performance of project management, (3) project management for specific areas, and (4) project management process in organizations. Each category classifies the project management maturity models according to their characteristics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The benefits of lean adoption in healthcare include improved process efficiency and quality of patient care. However, research indicates that lean implementation in healthcare, and specifically hospitals, is often not sustained. Furthermore, there is a need for maturity models that guide lean implementation, specifically in hospitals. This study develops a prescriptive maturity model named the Sustaining of Lean Adoption in Hospitals Roadmap (SOLAR) that acts as a practical guideline for the sustainable adoption of lean in hospitals. Methods: The SOLAR has three theoretical foundations, namely lean implementation success factors in hospitals, implementation science, and change management theory. A systematic literature review was conducted to determine the lean implementation success factors in hospitals as the first building block. Secondly, practices from implementation science were used to create the action items in the SOLAR. Ten change steps were elicited from change management theory as the third theoretical building block of the roadmap. We refined the roadmap through three Delphi rounds that verified its useability in hospitals. Results: The final SOLAR consists of four maturity phases (prepare, plan, experiment and learn, and sustain) and includes action items for each phase related to the hospital’s strategy, resources, engaging of people, and culture. The action items and change management steps shown in the SOLAR are not intended as an exhaustive list but provide guidelines on aspects hospitals must consider when they aim to adopt lean sustainably. Conclusions: The strong theoretical base of the SOLAR enables hospitals to safely experiment and learn which implementation methods are best suited to their unique environment. The SOLAR is, therefore, an actionable guideline that informs both academics and practitioners involved in lean adoption in hospitals. This roadmap can guide future retrospective longitudinal or action research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Evaluating supply chain resilience is essential to avoid escalating disruptions. However, the literature on this topic is fragmented, and the assessment of resilience remains an open gap due to the lack of a clear definition of the dimensions and elements for its evaluation. To fill this gap, this study integrates a systematic literature review (SLR) and a systematic literature network analysis (SLNA) to propose a MAturity MOdel for REsilient Supply Chains (MaMoReS). Through content analysis and stringent selection of 15 resilience maturity models (ResMMs) via SLR, along with an SLNA on 6,474 sources, this method defines dimensions and sub-dimensions. The proposed MaMoReS is framed around five levels and five dimensions: risk management, agility, flexibility and adaptability, redundancy and robustness, transparency and visibility, and collaboration and relationships. The MaMoReS is applied to two case studies, pinpointing the practicality of the MaMoReS for measuring the resilience maturity level of the two companies along with their dimensions and sub-dimensions scoring. Thus, the MaMoReS can be used as an assessment tool by supply chain managers and researchers to evaluate the resilience of a supply chain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) is crucial for SMEs to streamline operational efficiency, foster innovation, and meet upcoming challenges. Integrating sustainability into this process not only enhances a company’s reputation but also attracts customers and investors who value environmental responsibility. Despite this opportunity, many SMEs operate without clear plans and strategies. The literature review identified a lack of roadmaps that integrate sustainability into the digital transformation process for SMEs. Thus, this paper aims to propose a sustainable digital transformation roadmap for SMEs that evaluates their digital maturity and facilitates gradual implementation in alignment with their strategic objectives. A systematic literature review using the Methodi Ordinatio defined six key dimensions of digital transformation. Consequently, the SDT-SMEs Roadmap was developed, drawing on ISO/IEC 33000 standards to offer well-defined processes for enhancing digital competencies. The roadmap features three organizational planning levels—strategic, tactical, and operational—and includes a maturity model that evaluates 75 processes across six dimensions: Digital Technologies, Customer Focus, Organizational Culture, Organizational Governance, People, and Sustainability. Validation through a case study confirmed the roadmap’s effectiveness in addressing real-world challenges and guiding SMEs through the digitization process. The SDT-SMEs Roadmap provides a comprehensive and integrated approach, ensuring continuous adaptation and improvement in sustainable digital transformation efforts. This roadmap addresses a significant gap in the literature and presents a practical, strategic, and adaptable pathway for SMEs embarking on their digital transformation journeys. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {For many organizations, implementing knowledge management (KM) is a challenge. With the aim of deriving insights for guiding future research in KM implementation, this systematic literature review, conducted on October 28, 2023, using the Scopus and Web of Science databases, examined 174 articles from 108 journals. The search, employing the terms ((framework or “maturity model” or implementation) and “knowledge management”), disregarded time constraints. The information extracted included journal details, authors, authors' countries, number of authors, research method, objectives, dimensions of frameworks or maturity models, and suggestions for future research. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were applied to the collected data, revealing that the 174 articles involved 432 authors and were distributed across 108 journals. Key findings indicate: (a) a need for more research into strategies, practices, and technology for aiding KM implementation and evaluation; and (b) the potential for testing models and frameworks in diverse contexts (country, sector, and size). In response to the analysis, a KM implementation roadmap was formulated, encompassing five stages: diagnosis, design, implementation, implementation improvement, and evaluation. This study enhances academic understanding by highlighting pertinent topics in KM implementation and identifying avenues for further investigation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A maturity model for Industry 4.0 (I4.0 MM) with influencing factors is designed to address maturity issues in adopting Industry 4.0. Standardisation in I4.0 supports manufacturing industry transformation, forming reference architecture models (RAMs). This paper aligns key factors and maturity levels in I4.0 MMs with reputable I4.0 RAMs to enhance strategy for I4.0 transformation and implementation. Design/methodology/approach: Three steps of alignment consist of the systematic literature review (SLR) method to study the current published high-quality I4.0 MMs, the taxonomy development of I4.0 influencing factors by adapting and implementing the categorisation of system theories and aligning I4.0 MMs with RAMs. Findings: The study discovered that different I4.0 MMs lead to varied organisational interpretations. Challenges and insights arise when aligning I4.0 MMs with RAMs. Aligning MM levels with RAM stages is a crucial milestone in the journey toward I4.0 transformation. Evidence indicates that I4.0 MMs and RAMs often overlook the cultural domain. Research limitations/implications: Findings contribute to the literature on aligning capabilities with implementation strategies while employing I4.0 MMs and RAMs. We use five RAMs (RAMI4.0, NIST-SME, IMSA, IVRA and IIRA), and as a common limitation in SLR, there could be a subjective bias in reading and selecting literature. Practical implications: To fully leverage the capabilities of RAMs as part of the I4.0 implementation strategy, companies should initiate the process by undertaking a thorough needs assessment using I4.0 MMs. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in being the first to examine the alignment of I4.0 MMs with established RAMs. It offers valuable insights for improving I4.0 implementation strategies, especially for companies using both MMs and RAMs in their transformation efforts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

China, as an emerging force among developing countries, is diligently striving to catch up in this particular domain. As such, this study aspires for a cross-fertilization of ideas between China and international research. Furthermore, this study aims to ascertain the present state of affairs in this field and evaluate it in light of the demands for the digital transformation of vocational education. This Systematic Literature Mapping (SLM) focuses on three main areas of work. First, the quantitative trends of Chinese and international (here referring to countries other than China) research in the last decade are analyzed. Second, the theoretical framework based on the People-Process-Technology (PPT) theory is extended to provide a detailed current research theme analysis. Third, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is adapted, and relevant studies are assessed and coded for analysis based on this framework. The research finds that the number of current domestic and international studies in the field of the digitalization of vocational teaching has shown growth. The scope of the research focuses on two dimensions: the application of teaching modes and the construction of digital teaching environments. The maturity of domestic and foreign research is generally at the basic level. Researchers should seek innovation or optimize the application of research based on the scope and maturity of dimensions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In the public sector (PS), the principles of good governance have necessitated an evolution in financial reporting. This study aimed to design a model of accounting and financial maturity for PS reporting units. This study has a mixed-methods design. The initial MM was designed using a systematic review and expert panel discussions. Then, five focus group interviews were held over seven sessions. Next, a questionnaire was distributed among Iranian PS experts to validate the components of the MM. Thirty-two people filled out the questionnaire. A binomial test was used to validate the dimensions of the model. The outcome of this study was the design of a MM for accounting and financial reporting in PS units. The model was designed in five levels and includes eight dimensions, namely leadership, budgeting and financial planning, financial leadership and supervision, efficiency and effectiveness, rules and regulations, financial reporting, human capital and information technology. This model can be used as a basis for assessing the performance of PS units and to implement good governance in organizations. This model is applicable to all developing countries that utilize the revised International PS Accounting Standards and seek to establish a new PS management approach and performance-based budgeting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As reliance on advanced technical infrastructure grows, the potential for cyber crises to disrupt operations and compromise critical data and infrastructure has increased significantly. Poorly managed responses can have catastrophic consequences for both organizations and national security. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of recent studies on cyber crisis management capabilities, spanning from 2018 to 2024, and emphasizes the need for a sociotechnical approach. By utilizing the hexagonal socio-technical systems framework by Clegg et al., which includes people, culture, goals, technology, infrastructure, and processes, and analysing them with Nvivo and Delphi, we developed a Cyber Crisis Capability Model. This model identifies eight key criteria: security regulations and policies, clarity and compliance, technological reliability, human capital competence, resources and budgets, organizations, stakeholder collaboration, and cultural integration. It integrates strategic, operational, and tactical components to provide a holistic approach to cyber crisis management. Our comprehensive framework aims to enhance organizations' capabilities to effectively manage and mitigate cyber crises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the transition to Industry 4.0 is not a straightforward journey in which organizations need assistance. A well-known approach that can be utilized during the early phases of the transition is to assess the capability of the organization. Maturity models are frequently used to improve capability. In this systematic literature review (SLR), we analyzed 22 maturity and readiness models based on 10 criteria: year, type, focus, structure, research methodology followed during the design of models, base frameworks, tool support, community support, objectivity, and extent of usage in practice. Our SLR provides a well-defined comparison for organizations to choose and apply available models. This SLR showed that (1) there is no widely accepted maturity/readiness model for Industry 4.0, as well as no international standard; (2) only a few models have received positive feedback from the industry, whereas most do not provide any practical usage information; and (3) the objectivity of the assessment method is controversial in most of the models.

	abstract = {DevOps (development and operations) is a set of collaborative practices that automate continuous delivery of new software versions with an aim to reduce the development life cycle and produce quality software products. Security is an important attribute of quality software. Software is secure if it does not allow the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data, code, or service to be compromised. In order to take full advantage of DevOps, security needs to play an integral part in the development life cycle of a software. The DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) refers to the integrating security practices within the DevOps process. DevSecOps promotes the shifting security to the early stages of a project. Traditionally, security testing is done towards the end of the software lifecycle. However, fixing issues later in the process is more costly than making sure defects do not happen in the beginning. DevSecOps goes beyond automation, continuous integration, testing and delivery processes, since it also encompasses people. In fact, DevSecOps promotes the collaboration between the development, operations, and security teams. When security comes into DevOps routines, people play an even more relevant role involving the collaboration between those teams and security team. In any organization policies, standards, procedures and code of conducts are designed for people to follow. People are executers of policies. The human factor is one of the major forces behind effectiveness, or failure of a security system. Traditionally, the organizations focus on protecting their infrastructure, from security threats and they ignore human behavior that may result in malicious activities during software development process. Human aspect is considered as one of the major reasons of security vulnerability is due to malicious human behavior, who are involved in DevSecOps process; human may make mistakes due to lack of security perceptions, skills, and knowledge. These mistakes would bring a great loss if they are not properly handled. To overcome this challenge, there is a need of a specific maturity model that help to assess and guide the DevSecOps adoption. The key objective of this research project is to develop a people maturity model for DevSecOps (PMM-DevSecOps), that could help the practitioners to assess and manage their security vulnerability caused by human malicious behavior and lack of skills. To address the objective of this research project, we will use the systematic literature review (SLR), multivocal literature review (MLR) and questionnaire survey approach to identify and validate the critical success factors (CSFs), critical challenges (CCHs) and the related best practices of human related vulnerabilities for DevSecOps. Using the identified CSFs, CCHs and their related best practices, we will develop the maturity levels of proposed maturity model (i.e., PMM-DevSecOps), based on the concepts of the existing maturity models in other software engineering domains and the perceptions of the practitioners and academic researchers. Every maturity level will comprise of different CSFs and CCHs that can help in assessing and managing security vulnerability caused by human malicious behavior and lack of skills. We are confident that the proposed model will provide a roadmap for software development organizations to measure their maturity to assess and improve their security vulnerability caused by human malicious behavior and lack of skills while executing DevSecOps process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The application of integrated project delivery (IPD) in conjunction with building information modeling (BIM) and Lean Construction (LC) as the efficient method for improving collaboration and delivering construction projects has been acknowledged by construction academics and professionals. Once organizations have fully embraced BIM, IPD and LC integration, a measurement tool such as a maturity model (MM) for benchmarking their progress and setting realistic goals for continuous improvement will be required. In the context of MMs literature, however, no comprehensive analysis of these three construction management methods has been published to reveal the current trends and common themes in which the models have approached each other. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, this study integrates systematic literature review (SLR) and thematic analysis techniques to review and categorize the related MMs; the key themes in which the interrelationship between BIM, IPD and LC MMs has been discussed and conceptualized in the attributes; the shared characteristics of the existing BIM, IPD and LC MMs, as well as their strengths and limitations. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) method has been used as the primary procedure for article screening and reviewing published papers between 2007 and 2022. Findings: Despite the growth of BIM, IPD and LC integration publications and acknowledgment in the literature, no MM has been established that holistically measures BIM, IPD and LC integration in an organization. This study identifies five interrelated and overlapping themes indicative of the collaboration of BIM, IPD and LC in existing MMs' structure, including customer satisfaction, waste minimization, Lean practices and cultural and legal aspects. Furthermore, the MMs' common characteristics, strengths and limitations are evaluated to provide a foundation for developing future BIM, IPD and LC-related MMs. Practical implications: This paper examines the current status of research and the knowledge gaps around BIM, IPD and LC MMs. In addition, the highlighted major themes serve as a foundation for academics who intend to develop integrated BIM, IPD, and LC MMs. This will enable researchers to build upon these themes and establish a comprehensive list of maturity attributes fulfilling the BIM, IPD and LC requirements and principles. In addition, the MMs' BIM, IPD and LC compatibility themes, which go beyond themes' intended characteristics in silos, increase industry practitioners' awareness of the underlying factors of BIM, IPD and LC integration. Originality/value: This review article is the first of a kind to analyze the interaction of IPD, BIM and LC in the context of MMs in current AEC literature. This study concludes that BIM, IPD and LC share several joint cornerstones according to the existing MMs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The various quality improvement (QI) frameworks and maturity models described in the health services literature consider some aspects of QI while excluding others. This paper aims to present a concerted attempt to create a quality improvement maturity model (QIMM) derived from holistic principles underlying the successful implementation of system-wide QI programmes. Design/methodology/approach: A hybrid methodology involving a systematic review (Phase 1) of over 270 empirical research articles and books developed the basis for the proposed QIMM. It was followed by expert interviews to refine the core constructs and ground the proposed QIMM in contemporary QI practice (Phase 2). The experts included academics in two academic conferences and 59 QI managers from the New Zealand health-care system. In-depth interviews were conducted with QI managers to ascertain their views on the QIMM and its applicability in their respective health organisations (HOs). Findings: The QIMM consists of four dimensions of organisational maturity, namely, strategic, process, supply chain and philosophical maturity. These dimensions progress through six stages, namely, identification, ad-hoc, formal, process-driven, optimised enterprise and finally a way of life. The application of the QIMM by the QI managers revealed that the scope of QI and the breadth of the principles adopted by the QI managers and their HOs in New Zealand is limited. Practical implications: The importance of QI in health systems cannot be overstated. The proposed QIMM can help HOs diagnose their current state and provide a guide to action achieving a desirable state of quality improvement maturity. This QIMM avoids reliance on any single QI methodology. HOs – using the QIMM – should retain full control over the process of selecting any QI methodology or may even cherry-pick principles to suit their needs as long as they understand and appreciate the true nature and scope of quality overstated.

	abstract = {Goal: This study aimed to propose a Technology Transfer Model oriented to Industry 4.0 (TTM4.0). Design/methodology/approach. Initially, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify existing gaps in Technology Transfer models: Another focus of the review was to determine the requirements for technological implementations in Industry 4.0. Thus, a specific TT model was built. Then, the model was validated through case studies in Brazilian companies (slaughterhouses). The methods employed to measure data and support decisions in the context of TT4.0 were AHP, Likert scale, and Fuzzy-TOPSIS. Results: Focusing on similar results between Companies A and B, thinking about adopting Industry 4.0, the central strategic needs were product quality, reducing human error, and reducing waste. Among the main factors inhibiting the maximum interest and availability of Industry 4.0 for both companies were high investment, lack of knowledge (procedures or in general), and uncertainties in results. Results indicate Big Data Analytics and artificial intelligence technologies. Originality/value: The Poultry Industry strengthens the economy and significantly impacts the country's socioeconomic indices. Despite this, the sector has a low level of technological maturity compared to others. Regarding the TTM4.0, while other models start by recognizing opportunities and then select technologies in the market, this model prioritizes phases of organizational self-knowledge for decision-making support. A primary difference between a maturity model and a Technology Transfer model is in their scope, with the latter being broader. It encompasses technology definition, implementation, and management, rather than being limited to diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT), serving as a powerful tool for reflecting semantic and complex properties of underground infrastructure, plays a crucial role in optimising decision-making and closing sensing-control loop. Its application has demonstrated promising potential in advancing project quality and construction efficiency. Nevertheless, the absence of a maturity model (MM) limits the comprehension, evaluation, advancement, and implementation of DT. A quantitative MM further provides insights and benchmarks for technological advancement and functional completeness. The study firstly proposes a five-level maturity hierarchy based on systematic literature review and specialities of underground infrastructure. A qualitative evaluation system is constructed comprising 5 dimensions and 13 rubrics. Considering the interdependencies among rubrics, a D-ANP (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory & Analytical Network Process) method is utilized to evaluate the maturity level and assign weights to rubrics. Effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed MM are demonstrated through case studies involving subway station and tunnel DTs. The results indicate that the MM provides valuable perspectives and enables cross-disciplinary and multi-phase comparisons of DTs from the technological perspective. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The need for digital transformation is constant and understanding the mechanisms that aid organizations in achieving successful transformations is crucial. This study combines the dynamic capabilities theory with the perspective of digital maturity by answering the question, "What are the capabilities underlying the ability to become a digitally mature organization?" A systematic review of studies that investigated digital transformation from a maturity perspective was conducted and the findings were consolidated into a conceptual framework structured according to the dynamic capabilities lens. The framework was then compared to insights from case studies of four digitally mature organizations using the flexible pattern-matching approach. As a result, a framework of digital transformation dynamic capability was proposed, consisting of five thematic areas of action: designing and managing transformation, fostering digital value propositions, acting in digital business ecosystems, systematizing structural changes, and supporters and enablers. The main implication of this study is the original approach for consolidating and organizing previous literature on digital transformation that can guide organizations to articulate and develop specific processes and resources to mature digitally, leading to a capacity for continuous change in the perpetually evolving digital landscape. There are also implications for theory building, as the proposed framework can serve as an agenda for future research on dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The trend toward global software development (GSD) has grown tremendously in recent years because of the rapid acceleration in information and communication technologies (ICTs). The reason for the changing trend toward GSD is to develop high-quality software with minimum cost and time with round the clock. Despite the benefits gained from GSD, there are certain challenges associated with it. Literature reveals that software integration is an integral challenge in the GSD domain and vendors face numerous difficulties in integrating the software components to build the final product. The main aim of this research study is to develop a software integration model (SIM) that will assist GSD vendors to address the factors linked with various stages of software integration. This model is basically designed for GSD vendor organizations to assess and improve their software integration-related activities. However, it is also beneficial for GSD client organizations in getting knowledge about the status of the GSD vendor organization's software integration capabilities. The research design is composed of well-known research strategies including systematic literature review (SLR), questionnaire survey, and case study approach. This research study yielded the SIM. We identified nine critical success factors (CSFs) and 10 critical barriers (CBs) in software integration through SLR-1 by extracting the data from a sample of 105 papers. Similarly, we also identified a total of 132 practices/solutions, for the identified CSFs and CBs in software integration, through SLR-2 from a sample of 40 papers. These identified factors and practices were validated from 96 global software industry experts/practitioners through online survey. The identified CSFs, CBs, and their associated practices have been arranged adequately across the six software integration levels of SIM. We have adapted SIM structure from capability maturity model integration (CMMI), implementation maturity model (IMM), and software outsourcing vendors readiness model (SOVRM). We also conducted six case studies in the software industry for SIM applicability and validity. The participants' feedback from the six case studies in GSD vendor's organizations portray that the SIM is beneficial for GSD vendors to assess their software integration capability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Featured Application: A robust Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of assessment instruments (maturity models, roadmaps, frameworks, and readiness assessments) to assess the level at which Industry 4.0 is deployed in an organization. The research provides a comprehensive perspective of readiness assessment instruments for Industry 4.0 digital transformation and sets the foundations for future action plans and projects. Nowadays, different Industry 4.0 technologies have been implemented into diverse industries. However, these implementations are not standardized across similar industries and countries. Consequently, companies are actively looking for assessment instruments—maturity models, roadmaps, frameworks, readiness assessments—to assist in their digital transformation, to determine their Industry 4.0 level, and to identify technologies and strategies that should be implemented in specific areas, thus developing a feasible implementation plan. A review is conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Literature Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology to analyze the different research works on assessment instruments focused on Industry 4.0. A total of 538 articles, book chapters, conference proceedings, editorial material, reviews, and reports written in the English language were retrieved. Of these, 132 research papers were examined using a mixed analysis format to generate bibliometrics, and 36 articles were then deeply studied for a complete meta-analysis. The findings and insights of this meta-analysis led to a compilation and summary of dimensions, outcomes, enablers, and key components typically involved in Industry 4.0, which are comprehensively integrated to present the best practices for assessing Industry 4.0 and deploying a digital transformation that can impact productivity, flexibility, sustainability, quality, costs, and time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is extensively used in production-ready applications, calling for mature engineering techniques to ensure robust development, deployment and maintenance. Given the potential negative impact machine learning (ML) can have on people, society or the environment, engineering techniques that can ensure robustness against technical errors and adversarial attacks are of considerable importance. In this work, we investigate how teams of experts develop, deploy and maintain software with ML components. Moreover, we link what teams do to the effects they aim to achieve and provide means for improvement. Towards this goal, we performed a mixed-methods study with a sequential exploratory strategy. First, we performed a systematic literature review through which we mined both academic and grey literature, and compiled a catalogue of engineering practices for ML. Second, we validated this catalogue using a large-scale survey, which measured the degree of adoption of the practices and their perceived effects. Third, we ran validation interviews with practitioners to add depth to the survey results. The catalogue covers a broad range of practices for engineering software systems with ML components and for ensuring non-functional properties that fall under the umbrella of trustworthy ML, such as fairness, security or accountability. Here, we present the results of our study, which indicate, for example, that larger and more experienced teams tend to adopt more practices, but that trustworthiness practices tend to be neglected. Moreover, we show that the effects measured in our survey, such as team agility or accountability, can be predicted quite accurately from groups of practices. This allowed us to contrast the importance of the practices for these effects as well as adoption rates, revealing, for example, that widely adopted practices are, in reality, less important with respect to some effects. For instance, writing reusable scripts for data cleaning and merging is highly adopted, but has a limited impact on reproducibility. Overall, our study provides a quantitative assessment of ML engineering practices and their impact on desirable properties of software with ML components, by which we open multiple avenues for improving the adoption of useful practices.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyze and synthesize the design features of existing digital transformation maturity models with a developed classification scheme and propose a generic maturity model development wireframe based on design science research. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review is conducted on digital transformation maturity models in peer-reviewed journals, including the Emerald Insight, Science Direct, Scopus, Taylor & Francis and Web of Science databases, which resulted in 21 studies. A concept-centric tabular approach is used to analyze the studies, and intersectional demonstrations are used to synthesize the findings regarding the design features. Findings: The classification scheme derived from the tabular concept-centric approach and iteratively evolved results in three main and 25 subcategories related to the design features. Analysis and synthesis of the studies reveal the granularity of the existing digital transformation maturity models concerning the design features. Furthermore, considering the design features in the classification scheme, a generic maturity model development wireframe is proposed to guide the researchers. Research limitations/implications: The generic maturity model development wireframe and the classification scheme that represents the design features of existing maturity models guide the researchers for the maturity model development roadmap. Originality/value: The existing literature review studies do not focus on the design feature of digital transformation maturity models within a systematic literature review perspective. A unique classification scheme derived from the tabular concept-centric approach aims to analyze the granularity level of the existing models. Furthermore, the generic maturity model development wireframe includes the guidelines and recommendations of design science studies and presents a roadmap for maturity model researchers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are pivotal to the economy of many countries, including the United Kingdom. With the advent of digital technologies, the imperative of digital transformation has become increasingly salient for firms striving to retain competitiveness and relevance. However, SMEs lag behind larger organizations in adopting digital transformation, primarily due to the inadequacies of existing models tailored to the SME sector. Consequently, there is a palpable exigency for a pragmatic and tailored digital transformation framework specifically catered to SMEs operating in the UK. This research addresses this gap by proposing a practical digital transformation framework tailored to the unique characteristics and requirements of SMEs in the UK. Utilizing qualitative research methodologies within the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA model), existing research articles and digital transformation models have been meticulously evaluated to devise a novel framework. The resulting framework comprises six pivotal dimensions: strategy, organization, technology, innovation, culture, and change. It distinguishes itself by its adaptability, simplicity, and flexibility, allowing SMEs to tailor it according to their distinct business models and operational contexts. Despite the scarcity of literature on SME digital transformation in the UK, this research paper serves as a seminal contribution, addressing a critical gap and endowing SMEs with a pragmatic toolkit to navigate the complexities of digital transformation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The proposed model has five maturity levels: assess and align, engage and refine, innovate and collaborate, optimize and personalize, and transform and decarbonize. This paper aims to assess the current level of digital decarbonization and determine the position of the organizations. Additionally, it endeavours to identify the specific opportunities for growth that digitalization presents, thereby enabling the creation of a new digital carbon-free existence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This systematic review provides an in-depth analysis of existing information security awareness (ISA) maturity models. This review synthesizes findings from 25 scholarly articles, identifying standard dimensions such as risk management, organizational culture, training programs, policy compliance, and technical measures. Despite diverse approaches, significant gaps are evident, particularly the absence of tailored models for specific organizational types like public sector entities. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data and expert opinions in many models introduces biases, limiting their applicability. The findings underscore the need for organizations to adopt a comprehensive approach to ISA maturity, combining technical controls with behavioral assessments. This holistic view is essential for developing robust ISA maturity frameworks to address evolving cyber threats. Emphasizing compliance with established standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001, is critical to enhancing ISA across industries. Future research should focus on validating and refining ISA maturity models in diverse contexts and industries. This includes testing models in different organizational settings to ensure broader applicability and developing frameworks integrating technical and behavioral dimensions. Addressing sector-specific tailoring, integrating technical and managerial aspects, and providing rigorous empirical validation are critical for developing more effective and adaptable models. Developing ISA maturity models specifically tailored for the public sector is vital due to these organizations’ unique challenges and responsibilities. Utilizing updated versions of standards like ISO 27000 series provides a robust framework for maintaining high information security awareness and preparedness standards. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the construction literature lacks a systematic guidance of maturity models to inform the transition to circularity in organisational practices, give away SCC. This study aims to conceptualise dimensions of maturity for institutionalising SCC practices in construction firms. A systematic literature review including 31 peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on other industries was conducted to identify the maturity dimensions relevant to SCC and their suitability for use in construction firms was discussed. Ten dimensions and associated attributes were identified showing relevance to the eight Porter's value chain activities. This suggests their sufficiency in depicting smart circular values in construction firms. However, the weighting, i.e. importance, of the dimensions and their attributes specific to construction companies is unknown. Future research will verify the proposed dimensions and establish weighting for the dimensions. This will facilitate the development of a maturity model to assess and inform the transition to SCC in construction firms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Despite recognising the value of integrating ImTs into construction safety training and the considerable research devoted to its technical aspects, organisations face challenges in its adoption. The lack of standardised frameworks and reliance on outdated training methods are major barriers, hindering the full realisation of ImT's benefits for safety training. This study aims to establish an organisational readiness model that identifies critical attributes for successful ImTs implementation. Through a combination of systematic literature review (SLR) And questionnaire-based expert verification, fourteen organisational attributes were identified, and grouped into three categories: people and organisational structure, technology, and lifecycle costs. This insight could help organisations better understand their capabilities and prepare plans for implementing ImTs in safety training.

	abstract = {Global institution’s and customers’ demand for sustainable products put pressure on organizations to integrate sustainability into their business strategies. Current organizational priorities on reporting the ratings over improving their business processes towards sustainability have called interest among Business Process Management (BPM) researchers. From the BPM perspective, guidance on gradual improvements is offered in the form of maturity models (MMs). Meanwhile, current models have limitations: corporate sustainability models lack quantification and validation, BPM models do not address specific sustainability capabilities, and green business process models fail to integrate economic and social aspects. Moreover, formulating multiple objectives during business initiatives often creates stakeholder tensions, necessitating the adoption of paradox theory to help organizations manage the issues. Therefore, this PhD research aims to bridge these gaps by developing a maturity model through the lenses of paradox theory and configurational theory to achieve sustainable BPM excellence and a balance of sustainable pillars. The research employs a mixed-method approach, including systematic literature reviews, an expert panel, multiple case studies, a survey, and design science research to ensure robust and validated sustainable BPM MMs. Theoretical contributions will enhance current BPM knowledge within a sustainable context, while practitioners will gain a validated tool for assessing their current state and achieving a desired maturity level of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a balanced manner. The intermediate findings of the first-year project reveal three categories of balancing efforts toward sustainable BPM: strategic, managerial, and technical approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This trend is growing in the manufacturing context, being recognized as an opportunity to increase economic, environmental and social sustainability. To support companies in the transition towards servitization, Maturity Models represent a powerful tool to assess the maturity, strengths, and weaknesses and identify improvement activities. Existing literature proposes multiple maturity models for servitization and product service systems, with different focuses and structures. This paper aims to analyze the status of the existing literature on maturity models for servitization, identifying main characteristics, structures, trends, and gaps. To achieve this objective the paper operated a systematic literature review, including the identification and analysis of 19 contributions and 16 distinct maturity models. Based on the findings of the literature, the paper proposes categories of analysis that should be considered while assessing the maturity of companies involved in the servitization transition.

	abstract = {Sustainability has become an evolving paradigm within academia. This emergence has led organizations to innovate their business processes to remain competitive, meet customer expectations regarding sustainability, and comply with governmental regulations to achieve sustainability goals. This necessitates organizations to innovate their business processes beyond being profit-oriented. However, knowledge about the pathways of succeeding a sustainable process innovation is currently limited. Considering capability areas and business process maturity models (MMs) as key roles in a process innovation’s pathway, this paper emphasizes the scarcity of existing sustainability measurement items for assessing and innovating business processes, highlighting the need for clearer guidance. We provide a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the current state of literature and evaluate the progression of a related maturity quantification. Finally, our research unveils the interplay between the triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability dimensions (i.e., ecology, economy, and social), emphasizing the need for extending beyond profit-oriented business process innovation. Our insights call for integrating the sustainability dimensions to facilitate maturity when prioritizing BPM investments based on configuration theory. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The present study aims to raise the main traditional methods of Project Management, to present them in more detail, through a Systematic Literature Review. In this review, 37 articles were found and analyzed to answer five research questions. The research questions focused on answering: the main traditional project management methods, the most relevant maturity models, trends in the area, and the challenges and future directions for project management. As the main results, PMBOK was pointed out as the main traditional method, followed by PRINCE2, ISO 21500 standard and CTCR methodology. In addition, highlighting the tools, there are Gantt Chart, Earned Value Management, Critical Chain Project Management, and TOC Method as the most relevant. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a broad and detailed view of the main traditional methods of PM and with this, researchers in the area will be able to make better decisions in choosing the appropriate method for their type of project. As for challenges and future directions, the article pointed out that currently, project processes are complex and therefore do not meet their initial deadlines, cost, quality and business goals. Thus, difficulties in PM also stand out: delays in the schedule, lack of clearly defined objectives and support from leadership/company, scope changes, insufficient resources, poor risk management and measurement of project performance and lack of communication. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To assist software development organizations in responding to the challenges posed by dynamically changing consumer behavior and market needs, the research examined and compared existing DevOps maturity models. The innovative technique known as DevOps tackles the issue of smooth coordination between teams working on development and operations. However, software development organizations are challenged while practicing DevOps since it makes broader changes in the software development process. The DevOps maturity model helps to determine the current and desired level of DevOps adoption. Different researchers and practitioners have introduced DevOps maturity models in recent years. However, no standard DevOps maturity model is available and not many researchers have focused on critically studying and evaluating existing maturity models. The study applied a systematic literature review method to choose twenty-one publications. A comparison and identification of fifteen DevOps maturity models highlighted distinct viewpoints, areas of focus, maturity levels, and validation techniques. The discussion emphasized the necessity for more empirical study on DevOps maturity, a look into model integrations, and ongoing innovation in the dynamic DevOps industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With an increasing number of digitalization initiatives in the public sector, public shared service providers that deliver and steering bodies that orchestrate the realization of those initiatives are under pressure to become agile, i.e., to adopt agile activities, principles, and an agile mindset. This study investigates challenges and corresponding mitigation measures of scaled agile transformations of such organizations. Based on data gathered through Action Research based multiple case studies and drawing on context theory, it identifies obstacles related to the political, environmental, and internal context as well as transformation management itself. Among them are siloed actions and individual interests, IT legacy, complexity of customer requirements, insufficient resources, no shared vision, low professionalization, and a missing holistic picture. Value stream thinking, architectural thinking, successful pilot projects, constructive criticism, and a culture of failure are suggested as countermeasures. The identified obstacles and measures fit well into and extend the findings from a systematic literature review. Our contribution is to contextualize and extend insights and recommendations related to the large-scale agile transformation of public shared service providers and steering bodies that both serve multiple customers, i.e., other public sector organizations. Further research can quantitatively test the measures, develop maturity models for them, or identify obstacle-measure-patterns. Practitioners receive insights that should also contribute to a more successful transformation of the public sector in the benefit of society and economy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 adoption in industry and business has grown extensively. Supply chain had an opportunity to adopt Industry 4.0 in improving flexibility, efficiency, and response to consumer demands. Considering Industry 4.0, adoption in supply chain operations must be realized as an opportunity and challenge for practitioners. Hence, this study conducted a systematic literature review with a qualitative and quantitative approach to formulate supply chain 4.0 dimensions and operations in assessing readiness for adopting industry 4.0. A Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and bibliometric analysis are performed to analyze the literature related to industry 4.0 adoption in supply chain operations. This research combined a qualitative and quantitative analysis in reviewing the literature to deliver a broader benefit of Industry 4.0 in supply chain operations. This study found 525 papers related to Industry 4.0. Moreover, only twenty papers discussed supply chain specifically. Literature analysis using quantitative and qualitative approach showed that industry 4.0 adoption in the supply chain is limited to the maturity model with digital transformation. This study proposed five comprehensive dimensions to capturing supply chain operations: technology and information technology (IT) infrastructure, supply chain integration and coordination, manufacturing operations and inventory, leadership and human resources, and sustainability. The proposed dimensions for supply chain operations are based on a conceptual analysis of literature. Further verification and empirical analysis is needed to gain deeper insights. While digital technology and transformation are the main focus of Industry 4.0 adoption in many sectors, supply chain management requires broader applications as it involves various sectors and stakeholders. To further analyze this, a readiness and maturity model needs to be developed to assess the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the supply chain, taking into consideration the proposed dimensions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, most industrial processes require increased attention to the rational use of resources in line with economic, environmental, and social principles. In this context, products in a state of deterioration present valid solutions for reintegration into the lifecycle through the use of recovery, restoration, and reuse techniques. The so-called remanufacturing process is a facilitator of sustainability and circular economy practices through the design of closed-loop supply chains. However, transitioning from linear to closed-loop supply chains through the introduction of remanufacturing is not straightforward. For this reason, the aim of this paper is to provide a tool for assessing the readiness level for introducing remanufacturing from a circular economy perspective. A multi-methodological design approach, including a systematic literature review on readiness models and a systematic literature network analysis for remanufacturing adoption, is employed to identify gaps and propose a novel readiness model. The results propose R4CE, a remanufacturing readiness model for circular economy adoption in closed-loop supply chains. The model assesses the readiness on five levels and the three dimensions of collaboration mechanisms, closed-loop supply chain decisions, and policies and regulations. The research findings may be of interest to practitioners and researchers for readiness assessment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Assessing User eXperience (UX) maturity is mandatory in the free and open-source software (FOSS) community to avoid wasting resources on projects that may fall short of expectations. Best practices suggest employing UX Capability Maturity Models (UXCMMs), which often specify an evolutionary plateau toward developing a UX-matured system and quantify organizational UX maturity into maturity levels ranging from no or ad hoc improvement to integrated continuous improvement. Numerous generically developed UXCMMs exist. However, none is created for the FOSS community, and less information is available to support their perfect match. Thus, raise suspicions if they have proper UX maturity influencing factors (UXMIFs) for the FOSS community or measure the right thing. The FOSS community differs from traditional software-developing communities and may have different dynamics and UXMIFs, necessitating unique and new methodologies for their discovery. This study, therefore, aims to identify the FOSS community’s UXMIFs and evaluate the community’s knowledge of UX maturity-related concepts. Its findings may help future researchers, practitioners, and other FOSS developers to develop UXCMMs exclusive to the FOSS community. The study’s design is both qualitative and quantitative. It adopted a systematic literature review, interviews, fuzzy Delphi Method, and thematic analysis to collect and analyze data and present the findings. The study’s sample included sixty-two active FOSS projects, fifteen FOSS stakeholders, and twelve UX experts. The outcome shows that 84% of UX experts agreed on the thirty-six FOSS’s UXMIFs with threshold d = 0.143 and crisp values greater than α-cut = 0.5. User feedback and adopted technologies were ranked first, while learnability and use speed were ranked last. Similarly, FOSS stakeholders have shown a shared understanding of UX maturity, connected concepts, and impacting factors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smart cities are one of the consequences of digital transformation, and there have been many attempts to assess the smartness of cities with various frameworks. Among these frameworks, smart city maturity models (SCMMs) evaluate the existing conditions of cities and provide guidelines for progressing through the subsequent stages of maturity. However, most maturity models follow the instructions of the first model, published by the International Data Corporation, and there are many similarities across the models. These maturity models have advantages and disadvantages, while previous studies have not addressed the differences. Therefore, this article fills this knowledge gap by systematically reviewing the existing SCMMs. The findings suggest that some trending topics, such as resiliency concerning global pandemics and cultural aspects are neglected in SCMMs. Moreover, the validation techniques of the models are not rational. Finally, given the theoretical nature of most models, they cannot be applied to multiple regions.

This proves that the organization needs to engage effectively with its stakeholders to maintain itself in the VUCA world. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are no exception in such a scenario. However, there are various enablers and inhibitors in knowledge exchange dynamics (KED) in a university setting. So based on this, the study develops an inhibitor-based model for implementing KED in university projects. The inhibitors are identified through a systematic literature review and validated by experts, such as academicians and their stakeholders. Prioritizing these inhibitors allowed the expert to concentrate on the most critical inhibitors using the Orders of Magnitude-Analytic Hierarchy Process. Using the priority weights obtained from the model, a capability maturity model is developed to assess a university's capability and maturity level for a successful KED. From the capability maturity model results, one can understand the specific inhibitors that act as a hindrance to KED and set agenda for improvement for HEIs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This transformation poses significant challenges for businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In response, maturity models have been developed and adapted to facilitate a transparent and supportive entry into this transformative domain. Method/Aim: This study is dedicated to the comprehensive analysis of Industry 4.0 maturity models through a systematic literature review to identify and evaluate previously published recommendations for the adoption and utilization of Industry 4.0. The aim is to provide valuable insights in this context, with a particular focus on easing entry into this domain for SMEs. Results: Quantitative findings reveal a growing demand for fundamental support when entering this domain, with maturity models capable of meeting the demand for structured guidance. However, these models are currently under-validated, lacking transparency, and are often unsuitable for SMEs. Qualitative results categorize numerous insights and recommendations into ten distinct categories related to Industry 4.0. Conclusions: This paper provides a structured summary to support newcomers, research institutions, and businesses in effectively initiating and optimizing their Industrsy 4.0 activities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The topic of digital maturity has evolved into a full-grown hype in the last decade. It is widely assumed that the level of an organization’s digital maturity is directly linked to its performance. Digital Maturity Models (DMMs) have been designed specifically to assess an organization’s digital status quo and to provide concrete measures to increase its level of digital maturity. Given this relevance, a multitude of these models have emerged. Still, the development and application of DMMs is controversially discussed within the academic community leading to great uncertainty regarding their value for both theory and practice. In this systematic literature review, we seek to paint a comprehensive picture of the research field by identifying and contrasting the main contentious opinions among IS scholars. An analysis of detailed information regarding the research area – encompassing extensive DMM literature, academic discussion, and feedback – shows that various critical voices question the actual practical and theoretical value of DMMs, underlining the absence of objective evaluation criteria of these models and pointing out the lack of empirical data to prove the suggested relationship between maturity and performance. Based on our experience in this field, we provide a first synthesis of eleven years of DMMs and derive a research agenda. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Facing the growing interest in carrying out studies directed at sustainability, to the detriment of more prescient environmental and social impacts and the need to consolidate the concepts present in the literature regarding the SSCM, an absence of similar studies in the current literature was found. The authors have selected articles to compose a database that allows users to analyze and classify publications on MMs in SSCM, being those subdivided into 7 categories: focus, methodology, analyzed sector, sustainable practices, dimensions of sustainable development, type of MM and model/framework validation method. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this purpose, a literature systematization was conducted by searching publications using defined keywords in two databases and following a process of classification. The systematic process has five steps, from the selection of databases to the filtering of publications, review of information and analysis of the sample. Findings: The topic under study is promising, with a few publications dealing with it, mainly in Brazil, and there is a trend to exploit more of the area in future research. Originality/value: This research provides a detailed analysis of an emerging theme, divided into seven thematic categories. Results demonstrate that the topic is still underexplored, indicating an important research gap to be filled. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study investigates the enablers and challenges of digital supply chains (DSCs) adoption and develops a digital supply chain maturity (DSCM) model as a basis for developing guidelines for DSC adoption in the digital transformation journey. Design/methodology/approach: The research involves a systematic literature review (SLR) of Industry 4.0 (I4) adoption in supply chain (SC) practices to identify key enablers and associated maturity levels. The literature search of published articles during the 1997–2020 period and subsequent screening resulted in 64 articles. A DSCM model was developed using the categorization of important enablers and associated levels transitioning from the traditional SC to the DSC ecosystem. Findings: Four broader categories of DSC enablers and challenges were identified from the content analysis of SLR. Digital strategy alongside I4 technologies and human capital were prominent in DSC adoption as I4 technologies and human capital depend on other enablers such as dynamic capabilities (DCs). Lack of infrastructure and financial constraints to implementing I4 were significant challenges in the DSC adoption. Research limitations/implications: The proposed DSCM model provides a holistic view of enablers and maturity levels from traditional SC to DSC adoption. However, the DSCM model needs to be empirically validated and streamlined further using inputs from practitioners. Practical implications: The proposed DSCM model can be used as a framework to guide practitioners in assessing maturity and developing implementation plans for successful DSC adoption. Originality/value: This research introduces a novel DSC maturity model through a holistic view of enablers and maturity levels from traditional SC to DSC adoption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Industry 4.0 is characterised by the exponential pace of technological innovations compelling organisations to transform or be displaced. Industry 4.0 transformation of construction enterprises lacks systematic guidance and notable earlier studies have utilised maturity models to map transformation of enterprises. This paper proposes a conceptual maturity model for construction enterprises for business scenarios leading to Industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach: The requirements for designing maturity models, including comparison with existing models and scientifically documenting the design process, make Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) appropriate. Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are conducted to shortlist a total of 95 papers, which are subjected to subsequent content analysis. Findings: The first SLR identifies the following process categories as critical levers of industry 4.0 maturity; data management, people and culture, leadership and strategy, collaboration and communication, automation, innovation and change management. The second SLR ascertains that the existing maturity models in construction literature do not adequately correspond to Industry 4.0 business scenarios with limited emphasis on data management, automation, change management and innovation. The findings are assimilated to propose a conceptual Smart Modern Construction Enterprise Maturity Model (SMCeMM). Originality/value: The paper systematises the transformation of construction enterprises in Industry 4.0 and leads to state-of-the-art development of Industry 4.0 and maturity model research in construction. The proposed conceptual model addressed both the demands of the construction industry as well as what is required to navigate Industry 4.0 better. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Public–private partnership (PPP), a project financing arrangement between private investors and the public sector, has revolutionized the approach to the funding and development of public infrastructure worldwide. However, the increasing cases of financial risks and poor financial risk management related to the model threaten the sustainability and financial success of PPP projects leading to huge financial investment losses. This study aims to review existing literature to establish the key measures to control the financial risks of sustainable PPP projects. Design/methodology/approach: A PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review method was used in this study. Data were sourced from academic databases consisting of 56 impactful peer-reviewed journal articles. Findings: The review outcomes demonstrate 41 critical factors (measures) in mitigating the financial risks of sustainable PPP projects. They include minimum revenue guarantee, strategic alliance with private investors, financial transparency and accountability and sound macroeconomic policies. The principal results of the study were categorized and conceptualized into a financial risk management maturity model for sustainable PPP projects. Lastly, the study reveals that further studies and project policies must focus more on addressing financial challenges relating to climate risks, and health and safety concerns such as COVID-19 outbreak that have negative impacts on PPP projects. Research limitations/implications: The results provide essential research gaps and directions for future studies on measures to mitigate the financial risks of sustainable PPP projects. However, this study used small but significant existing publications. Practical implications: A checklist and a conceptual maturity model are provided in this study to help practitioners to learn and improve upon their practices to mitigate the financial risks of sustainable PPP projects.

	abstract = {Purpose: The study aims to review the currently available Industry 4.0 (I4.0) maturity models (MMs) for manufacturing industries and analyse their applicability in the oil and gas (O&G) upstream sector. Knowing that the growth in demand for energy through crude oil and natural gas is still viable over the next decade, there is the drive to ensure sustenance and improvement in production. The study sees an opportunity in harnessing the gains of Industry 4.0 technologies for better solution-driven strategies in production processes, equipment availability and reliability which would translate into higher production performance. So, a review on the Industry 4.0 MMs is considered important. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic and in-depth literature review was performed to identify the specific requirements of this industry. This study examined the key characteristics of the O&G upstream sector and identified research gaps that need to be addressed to successfully support this industry for Industry 4.0 implementation. An Industry 4.0 MM that reflects the industrial realities for this industry more accurately from insights drawn from reviews of existing MMs is proposed Findings: The review of 19 selected Industry 4.0 MMs revealed that the existing MMs are not a direct fit for the O&G upstream industry. Only a few of the models were clear on validation but with subjectivity, low number of persons and industries involved as limitations; none of the models confirmed validation with the O&G industry. There are varying views on the model dimensions and maturity levels by each author and not all required areas specific to the O&G industries were acknowledged by the models. An MM specific to this industry is therefore required. Originality/value: Although the journey of digitisation has commenced in the O&G industry, a reduction with the challenges of transition towards Industry 4.0 implementation and provision of support for improved efficiency is assured using a robust MM, as proposed in this paper. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The construction professionals' believed Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a way to improve the current construction practices more effectively and efficiently, specifically in applying Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR. 4.0) and during this pandemic situation. However, there is still uncertainty in relation to the interpretation of the successful BIM implementation in projects due to incompetent BIM personnel. Therefore, several models have used the maturity concept to evaluate the success of BIM implementation. This paper aims to conduct a narrative systematic literature review on the existing BIM maturity model that assesses the success of BIM implementation. The findings are expected to enrich an understanding of the current state of the BIM maturity model used to assist construction professionals in BIM implementation. However, the review shows that there is still a limitation of the BIM maturity model that could be used to improve current competencies as most of the model focuses on improving the use of BIM technology, client and facility managers' perspectives. Hence, further research is needed to focus on the developing maturity model that could be used to ensure the competencies of construction professionals before they can be acknowledged and certified as BIM competence persons. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper bridges this gap by integrating ES into the discourse of DT, proposing Green Enterprise Architecture (GREAN) as a method for sustainable transformation. Utilizing a Design Science Research approach, we developed an artefact outlining a comprehensive strategy for embedding ES in DT across various layers of an organization. The tool’s need was validated via a systematic literature review (SLR), highlighting the significant research gap in Green Enterprise Architecture. The artefact provides concrete Courses of Action (CoAs) for incorporating ES into the organizational strategy, business, data, application, and technology layers and proposes relevant capabilities to address this. The paper further presents an ES-aware business capability modelling, an innovative business modelling approach that integrates environmental sustainability principles by using (in a novel way) the presentation and analysis methods that capability mapping offers. The proposed artefact serves as a starting point for environmentally sustainable DTs. Future research directions include in-depth exploration of each enterprise layer for ES, real-world validation of our proposed tools and concepts, and the expansion of these into a full framework. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The paper aims to provide a systematic overview of the maturity models used in knowledge management (KM) with the purpose of identifying different perspectives, contributions, shortcomings, and implementation gaps. This study can be characterized as a theoretical research based on a systematic literature review. As a result of this analysis, KM key points and knowledge management maturity models (KMMMs) critical success factors (CSFs) are pointed out and recorded. The concept of standardization and its relation to KM, presenting known KM Standards and their core principles is explored. Even though there is a large number of publications on KM, a literature gap is identified in publications regarding the field of KM Standards and corresponding case studies. Based on the most widely spread critical success factors used in the knowledge management maturity assessment presented in the literature survey, the objective of this paper is to propose a holistic and integrated knowledge management maturity assessment framework encompassing the core guidelines of ISO 30401 in order to be used by researchers and practitioners for future reference in the form of a generic maturity assessment web matrix. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a maturity model (MM) to become a smart organization considering Lean as a key enabler to drive I4.0 adoption. A systematic literature review on I4.0 and Lean concepts plus I4.0 adoption models was conducted through the PRISMA method based on articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases, and records from official websites (e.g., consulting firms) published between 2011 and 2022. Identifying the Lean and I4.0 relationship and comparing the models’ relevant characteristics allowed the development of the MM proposal. Although previous research refers to Lean and I4.0 collaboration, the opportunity to design a reference model for adopting both approaches was identified since their interaction enhances value creation. The comprehensive model supports structuring the types of Lean principles/methods/tools and I4.0 technologies and their action to link them and define which of them need to be implemented according to the maturity level chronologically. Additionally, the proposed MM provides an adoption roadmap that starts eliminating non-added activities in the initial stages for process improvement to integrate I4.0 enabling technologies later. The model makes it possible for practitioners to generate implementation and development processes oriented toward I4.0 adoption based on maturity levels in which Lean has the starting point at the first ones. Hence, it defines the enabling technologies to be incorporated and linked throughout the value chain, enhancing a Lean culture. This model will help organizations to become “smart” by allowing them to transition toward the best technology investment and continuously add value to their processes, people, and products. Moreover, the results will motivate researchers to study further the application of models for I4.0 adoption in which Lean is integrated to fill the gap with the I4.0 embrace caused by quickly changing industrial environments and the uncertainty and unknowledge of guidelines associated with incorporating new technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Maturity models (MMs) are strategic tools used to assess and improve the current state of processes, objects, or people, with the goal of achieving continuous performance enhancement. While MMs are applied in various fields, their scope, design, and application criteria within Supply Chain Management and Logistics (SCML) lack comprehensive studies. This article aims to address this gap through a systematic literature review. The review analyzes 137 relevant articles using both bibliometric and content analysis techniques. The bibliometric analysis identifies major contributions, popular journals, and the classification and evolution of key keywords. The content analysis focuses on critical criteria related to the scope, design, and application of MMs. The findings reveal a growing emphasis on models assessing Industry 4.0 readiness and sustainability principles. However, several gaps are identified, including limited attention to optimizing and integrating logistic processes, underutilized and unvalidated MMs, and the absence of comprehensive improvement guidelines. Based on these trends and research gaps, this study proposes five recommendations for future developments that benefit both academics and practitioners. These recommendations aim to address the identified limitations and provide guidance for comprehensive and effective improvement strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Organizations that engage in GSD face various challenges, the majority being associated with requirements change management (RCM). The key motive of this study is to develop a requirement change management and implementation maturity model (SRCMIMM) for the GSD industry that could help the practitioners to assess and manage their RCM activities. A systematic literature review and questionnaire survey approach are used to identify and validate the critical success factors (CSFs), critical challenges (CCHs), and the related best practices of the RCM process. The investigated CSFs and CCHs are classified into five maturity levels based on the concepts of the existing maturity models in other domains, practitioners’ feedback, and academic research. Every maturity level comprises different CSFs and CCHs that can help assess and manage a firm's RCM capability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, four case studies are conducted in different GSD firms. The SRCMIMM has been developed to assist GSD organizations in improving their RCM process in efficiency and effectiveness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review existing smart manufacturing (SM) maturity models' dimensions and maturity levels to assess their applicability and drawbacks. There are many maturity models available but many of them have not been validated or do not provide a useful guide or tool for applications. This gap creates the need for a review of the existing maturity model's applicability. Design/methodology/approach: Nineteen peer-reviewed maturity models related to “Digital Transformation,” “Industry 4.0” or “Smart Manufacturing” were selected based on a systematic literature review and five consulting firm models were selected based on the author's industry knowledge. The chosen models were analyzed to determine 10 categories of dimensions. Then they are assessed on a 1–5 scale for how applicable they are in the 10 categories of dimensions. Findings: The five “consulting firm” models have a first-mover advantage, are more widely used in industry and are more applicable, but some require payment, and they lack published details and validation. The 19 “peer reviewed” models are not as widely used, lack awareness in the industry and are not as easy to apply because of no web tool for self-assessment, but they are improving. The categories defined to characterize the models and facilitate comparisons for users include “Information Technology (IT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and Data,” “Strategy and Organization,” “Supply Chain and Logistics,” “Products and Services,” “Culture and Employees,” “Technology and Capabilities,” “Customer and Market,” “Cybersecurity and Risk,” “Leadership and Management” and “Governance and Compliance.” The analyzed maturity models were particularly weak in the areas of cybersecurity, leadership and governance. Practical implications: Researchers and practitioners can use this review with consideration of their specific needs to determine if a maturity model is applicable or if a new model needs to be developed. The review can also aid in the development of maturity models through the discussion of each of the dimension categories. Originality/value: Compared to existing reviews of SM maturity models, this research determines comprehensive dimension categories and focuses on applicability and drawbacks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Additionally, existing models for its adoption focus on technology incorporation, process improvement, and organizational transformation. Therefore, the opportunity exists for designing a new model that emphasizes developing employees’ competencies. A systematic literature review was conducted regarding existing models for I4.0 adoption and the desired worker competencies. After examining the gap in the current models and the categorization of their main elements, a new maturity model (MM) for I4.0 adoption, based on the development of employees’ competencies, is proposed. The MM helps practitioners and researchers assess an organization’s I4.0 adoption level in order to improve future actions. A validation process for the MM was implemented through the Delphi method. Additionally, a roadmap to guide workforce development is presented, which considers the digital challenges face by employees in advancing a strategic I4.0 adoption. The proposed roadmap allows for depicting new deployment strategies aligned with digital trends and employees’ commitments to sustaining the implementation efforts. This research recognizes talent, organizational culture, and communication plans as key elements for defining actions for developing the skills and competencies required for embracing the I4.0 enabling technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In meeting that need, lean construction maturity models (LCMMs) play a key role. However, there is less evidence of critical reviews in spite of the significant number of LCMMs available. Therefore, this study was initiated with the aim of systematically reviewing the literature on existing lean-construction-related maturity models (MMs) through a critical review. The study adopted the PRISMA method to review 24 such models using manual content analysis. The study revealed the most common attributes among the models, along with their key strengths and weaknesses. The findings of this study can be directly used to develop more robust LCMMs and enhance the knowledge base on theoretical underpinnings. From an industry perspective, the findings assist organizations to more effectively assess LC maturity. The study invites further research on the area of LC maturity and advocates for developing new MMs addressing these areas identified for improvement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {DevOps emerged as a better paradigm within the software organization. DevOps software is providing beneficial service for the organizations as it helps in reducing the resources in the terms of money, time and effort. Adopting new technology is not always easy, so is the case with DevOps. Software organizations are hesitant to adopt DevOps because the number of leader organizations in DevOps is very less. This is why the initial organization of DevOps does not follow the leader organization, but follows some maturity model. The maturity model gives an idea of the maturity level of DevOps within the software organization. The DevOps maturity model contain different levels of maturity. The distinguished maturity level is decided through certain parameters or metrics. The primary purpose of this study is to identify some set of priority metrics that influence DevOps adoption in software organizations. The method adopted for this study is systematic literature review (SLR). We extracted 32 metrics from 57 articles identified through systematic literature review. These metrics can be used to evaluate DevOps maturity within organizations. We believe that this study will serve as the basis for the development of maturity models to implement DevOps practices in software organizations. The proposed maturity model will be based on these metrics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper aims to design a new construction organizations’ risk-management maturity model (C.ORM3) using new hybrid techniques and a distinct validation strategy based on global and local experience, to assess risk management maturity level in developing countries. A multi-steps methodology was adopted in this research. The study adopted an excessive systematic literature reviews of 22 previous articles on RM maturity and four standards and guidelines for eliciting model components. These components include five attributes with 26 capabilities; 24 capabilities identified from literature review and 2 from experts. These capabilities are evaluated against five levels: immature, ad-hoc, standard, managed, and optimized. The authors adopted a new strategy for validating the model by three groups of global and local experts and verifying the proposed model in a realistic-world case study. This study is the first to use a hybrid method based on the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation (FSE) techniques in evaluating RM maturity (RMM). Iraqi construction organizations validate the practicality of the model. The results showed that the overall RMM level of the Iraqi construction sector is 1.52, between immature and ad-hoc. The model has been converted into a computer template for ease of use by organizations.

A digital maturity model is a critical success factor as it enables organizations to assess their current situation and create roadmaps aligned with their goals; however, a comprehensive systematic literature review covering the maturity models proposed by academia and consultancy firms is hard to find. Further, the existing models are sector-oriented, not organization-oriented, and do not consider the transformation journey holistically, but instead focus on model dimensions. This study first undertakes a comprehensive and up-to-date systematic literature review by applying the PRISMA approach using a bibliometric analysis tool capable of providing visual maps, then developing a unique holistic digital maturity model that covers several aspects of an organization’s digital transformation journey, from strategy to governance, and asking relevant questions. The hierarchical structure, comprising dimensions and sub-dimensions, presents content beyond the scope of other models. The results of the digital maturity assessment can be interpreted in parallel with the stages of the digital transformation. Consequently, the new holistic and sector-independent digital maturity model can be used by organizations in both the private and public sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Understanding factors and measuring a company’s maturity in addressing the I4.0 transformation is crucial to diagnose the company’s current condition and provide corresponding prescriptive action plan effectively. Despite the positive trend of maturity models for the industries, companies still face challenges with low I4.0 adoption rate. Designing a corresponding diagnostic framework into an intelligent maturity model will ultimately lead the company’s pathways toward the desired capabilities. In response, we systematically review and select the state-of-the-art research through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conduct to scrutinize the main characteristics of 14.0 Maturity Models. Subsequently, 35 exceptional articles published between 1980-2020 were selected for in-depth analysis of their structure, dimensions, and analytical features. Our analysis revealed the descriptive method have been widely used in many maturity models while few more-advanced prescriptive models design adopt fuzzy rule-base analytical hierarchy, knowledge based, Monte-Carlo methods, and even expert-system approaches.

The diagnosis results pointed that the level of implementation of Industry 4.0 is considered the first level, later advancing in this order to levels of connectivity, visibility, predictability and adaptability of the processes. Research limitations/implications: Only in one company was applied the developed instrument, in this case study, a factory that makes children's and adult clothing items located in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Practical implications: Through the use of this assessment instrument, it is possible to perform an internal benchmarking at the company detecting the strong and weak points, as well as involve a multidisciplinary collaborator team. Social implications: The comparisons and improvements may be carried out per dimension or sector, which motivates the constant application and assessment of improvements. The instrument to diagnose the maturity of Industry 4.0 technologies in the textile and clothing sector is considered an effective tool for application in a single company or to have its use expanded in a new piece of research to the entire industrial textile segment. Originality/value: The developed diagnostic tool may be used for both the internal assessment of the company and its placement relative to its competitors, involving several companies from the same sector. It is possible to know about what level of Industry 4.0 maturity the company is and after benchmarking by others and improve. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Big Data and analytics have become essential factors in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. As no company can escape the effects of the pandemic, mature Big Data and analytics practices are essential for successful decision-making insights and keeping pace with a changing and unpredictable marketplace. The ability to be successful in Big Data projects is related to the organization’s maturity level. The maturity model is a tool that could be applied to assess the maturity level across specific key dimensions, where the maturity levels indicate an organization’s current capabilities and the desirable state. Big Data maturity models (BDMMs) are a new trend with limited publications published as white papers and web materials by practitioners. While most of the related literature might not have covered all of the existing BDMMs, this systematic literature review (SLR) aims to contribute to the body of knowledge and address the limitations in the existing literature about the existing BDMMs, assessment dimensions, and tools. The SLR strategy in this paper was conducted based on guidelines to perform SLR in software engineering by answering three research questions: (1) What are the existing maturity assessment models for Big Data? (2) What are the assessment dimensions for Big Data maturity models? and (3) What are the assessment tools for Big Data maturity models? This SLR covers the available BDMMs written in English and developed by academics and practitioners (2007–2022). By applying a descriptive qualitative content analysis method for the reviewed publications, this SLR identified 15 BDMMs (10 BDMMs by practitioners and 5 BDMMs by academics). Additionally, this paper presents the limitations of existing BDMMs. The findings of this paper could be used as a grounded reference for assessing the maturity of Big Data. Moreover, this paper will provide managers with critical insights to select the BDMM that fits within their organization to support their data-driven decisions. Future work will investigate the Big Data maturity assessment dimensions towards developing a new Big Data maturity model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Public funding, being the primary source for innovation, imposes restrictions caused by a lack of trust between the roles of public funders and organisations in the innovation process. Capability and maturity innovation assessment models can improve the process by combining both roles to create an agile and trusting environment. This paper aims to provide a current description of the state-of-the-art on capability and maturity innovation assessment models in the context of Information and Communication Technologies. To this end, a Systematic Mapping Study was carried out considering high-quality published research from four relevant digital libraries since 2000. The 78 primary studies analysed show several gaps and challenges. In particular, a common ontology has not been achieved, and Innovation Management Systems are scarcely considered. Concepts such as open innovation have not been correctly applied to incorporate all Quadruple Helix stakeholders, especially the government and its role as a public funder. This implies that no studies explore a standard agile public–private maturity model based on capabilities since the public funders’ restrictions have not been considered. Furthermore, although some concepts of innovation capabilities have evolved, none of the studies analysed offer a comprehensive coverage of capabilities. As potential future lines of research, this paper proposes 11 challenges based on the 5 shortcomings found in the literature. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To assist these laboratories, maturity models (MMs) can be used for the implementation and maintenance of management systems. The use of fuzzy logic is often found in association with the construction of MMs. Fuzzy logic helps in the construction of these models, removing subjective elements from the maturity assessment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) using the Methodi Ordinatio focused on MMs built with fuzzy logic that aim to evaluate the degree of maturity of testing and calibration laboratories that have implemented ISO/IEC 17025 for their quality management systems (QMSs). This analysis was performed with articles published between 2012 and 2022 in several databases using keywords such as “maturity model”, “fuzzy” and “ISO 17025” and resulted in 18 articles, which made up the bibliographic portfolio. After analyzing the content of these studies, it was possible to conclude that, although no study specifically discussed this MM, the discovered articles were important for presenting ideas and suggestions for future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the introduction of Industry 5.0, a new paradigm shift is planned. Whereas Industry 4.0 is still focused primarily on economic objectives to be achieved through digital transformation and automation of monotonous work processes, Industry 5.0 will also bring in social and ecological objectives. The focus is on holistic, sustainable, and human-centered value creation. Thus, the complexity of digitalization is increasing with the implementation of direct collaboration between humans and machines. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are faced with major challenges as they have limited resources for implementing a successful digitalization strategy. This makes the use of maturity models (MMs) a valuable tool for shaping the strategically aligned digitalization transition of companies. In this context, this paper reviews whether the currently existing MMs for Industry 4.0 address the specific requirements of Industry 5.0, and sufficiently consider a human-centered approach along with the assessment of readiness for disruptive technologies in companies (especially SMEs). The study examines currently existing Industry 4.0 MMs as a part of a systematic literature review. A total of 297 German- and English-language publications were found and systematically investigated, of which 24 MMs provided sufficient scientific information in the end. These were categorized using a self-developed evaluation matrix. Furthermore, they were evaluated and discussed regarding their human-centered approach and applicability to SMEs. Through the analysis, key characteristics for Industry 4.0 MMs were identified, which can serve as a basis for the development of an Industry 5.0 assessment for SMEs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Patent management tasks involve many stakeholders from diverse disciplines and hierarchies as well as from inside and outside the organization. By drawing on the transaction cost and stakeholder theories, Blockchain technology offers new opportunities to rethink the way in which stakeholders are organized and collaborate. Although Blockchain technology receives considerable attention from both the public and academia, the question of how Blockchain technology leverages patent management in particular has so far been neglected, although it holds great promise. Consequently, this is what we choose to be our basic research question. In response to it, we conduct a systematic literature review, following a procedure in three steps. Out of an initial sample of 714 articles, we select 52 as being particularly relevant, and classify them in accordance with the dimensions of the 7D Patent Management Maturity Model. Three main foci regarding the use of Blockchain technology emerge – i.e. for the generation, the enforcement, and the exploitation of patents. This study contributes to scholarship and management by showing that Blockchain technology mitigates environmental and behavioral uncertainty, while stimulating new governance forms and business models by reorganizing or discarding stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Malaysia's tremendous growth has led the public to demand outstanding facilities and services in terms of quantity and quality. The need for transformation by the local authorities in Malaysia is, therefore, necessary to ensure that the maintenance of public facilities can be effectively implemented. To mitigate this situation, local authorities must have a framework comprising standardised maintenance practices. This study is one part of the preliminary research in developing the standard maintenance management framework. One of the components of the framework is improvement tools that aims to assessing and improving the current maintenance practices which can inform the local authorities of their maintenance performance so that possible actions for improvement could be taken. Thus, this study is focusing on the maturity model as the improvement tool that offers five-levels of maturity with different standards. The maturity assessment can determine the current practices and promotes improvement by moving to the higher level of maturity. This process promotes motivation and continually enhance maintenance management practices by local authorities. The methodology adopted is systematic literature review to examine the significant impacts on their management through multiple published research relevant to the use of the maturity model within different industries. Several criteria and characteristics of maturity model is compared to determine the significance of maturity model. As the maintenance management consisting numerous processes and involving massive resources, it is recommended for the organisation to practise continuous improvement to prevent losses in time, cost and quality. Through the comparisons on different industries and maintenance management practices, the maturity model is seen to be beneficial in assessing and improving the organisation’s performance and management. In conclusion, it will enable local authorities in creating competencies, cost-savings, and ensure the continuous improvement and sustainable performance of public facilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Today's markets are facing many uncertainties and challenges such as supply chain risk and demand uncertainty. If companies solely focus on competitive relationships with other stakeholders, it will turn out very challenging for them to maintain or grow their market share. Given its impact on competitiveness, several top managers have increased their interest in Sales and Operation Planning (S&OP) process, aiming to develop plans that provide decision makers the ability to direct their business to achieve competitive advantage on a continuous basis by integrating customer-focused plans for new and existing products with the management of the supply chain. Moreover, an Integrated Business Planning (IBP) conjugates S&OP with finance as a sign of mature S&OP. Literature lacks in the discrimination of the definition IBP and S&OP leading to a possible confusion to the reader. In the scientific community IBP is used as a synonym of S&OP, and it is necessary to clarify the definition of these two concepts in the academy. In fact, IBP is primarily used by companies to identify a financial planning tool. Thus, the innovative contribution of this paper is to clarify the concepts of S&OP and IBP, their points of contact and the differences and to investigate if and how IBP and S&OP can evolve, integrate, and possibly unify. Moreover, the aim of this paper is to perform a systematic literature review to analyze the future evolution of S&OP through its maturity model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of agile software development methods, new approaches for determining agile maturity have become necessary. Other than for traditional maturity and capability models like CMMI and ISO/IEC 15504, the field of agile maturity models is not yet settled. Even worse, a common understanding regarding agility in general and the levels of agility in particular is missing. The paper at hand aims to shed light on the field of agile maturity models with a particular focus on maturity levels, their definition, and their evaluation and computation. We conducted a systematic literature review to extract maturity levels and provide an initial harmonization of the levels found. Our findings from analyzing 19 agile maturity models show that there is yet no agreement with regard to the maturity levels. In total, 69 maturity levels have been analyzed for harmonization opportunities. Two major dimensions of maturity levels of agile maturity models could be identified: (1) team-related and (2) general maturity, which is comparable to standard approaches. However, the procedures to assess organizations and processes, if at all present, are to a large extent focused on persons and their personal opinion, which paves the way for future research, e.g., in terms of developing measurement systems for assessing agile maturity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The emergence of platform ecosystems has transformed the business landscape in many industries, giving rise to novel modes of interorganizational cooperation and value co-creation, as well as unconventional challenges. The vast traces of data generated by platform ecosystems makes them ripe for the use of analytics and data-driven methods aimed at improving their health, performance, business outcomes, and evolution. However, the research on the application of analytics within platform ecosystems is limited and spread across multiple disciplines. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review on the application of analytics and data-driven methods and practices within platform ecosystems. A total of 56 studies were reviewed, and underwent data extraction, analysis, and synthesis processes. In addition to presenting themes and patterns in the recent and relevant literature on platform ecosystems analytics, our review offers the following outcomes: an actionable overview of the analytics toolbox currently used within platform ecosystems - spanning domains such as machine learning, deep learning, data science, modelling, simulation, among others - ; a roadmap for practitioners to achieve analytics maturity; and a summary of underexplored research areas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this era of digital transformation, organisations and individuals have the ability to generate, collect, process, and analyse a vast volume of data to gain benefits and valuable insights. However, despite recognising the competitive advantage of digital transformation in data management, they often face challenges in navigating the transformation process and aligning their existing practices with on-premise technologies. Leadership and governance play a very significant role in digital transformation procedures. The main objectives of this research are 1) to establish a Leadership and Governance Stage Model (LGSM), which provides a standardised, structured, and objective roadmap for organisations to determine their current leadership and data governance maturity stage in digital transformation in data management and 2) to guide organisations in progressing to the next maturity stage by using LGSM as a framework. This research adopts a qualitative approach, utilising a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conducted over the past ten years, applying Grounded Theory. A total of 14 well-defined Capability Maturity Models (CMMs) of data management were reviewed, summarised, and consolidated. In this way, LGSM is established, comprising six stages: Stages 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, with Stage 5 representing the most developed and mature stage. The holistic view of this stage model has been summarised at the end of this research, which demonstrates the significance of leadership and governance in digital transformation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Several construction maturity models exist in various platforms, however, there seems a noticeable gap in the literature on existing maturity model attributes and a model template for construction sector. Therefore, to fill that gap, this study aimed at reviewing the existing construction maturity model attributes. PRISMA literature review technique was adopted to systematically review the existing, construction related maturity model attributes. The identified attributes were analysed using thematic analysis method. The study used twenty prominent construction maturity models to identify their key attributes. These attributes were analysed, and 13 key themes were derived that described model attributes. This study summarised all the literature findings on significant existing model attributes and established the foundation on how to derive attributes relevant to construction maturity models. Further, this study adds to the body of knowledge on construction maturity model attributes and opens up avenues to develop more robust maturity models. This study contributes to the practice by encouraging the use of maturity models and attributes to enhance the existing maturity of construction firms. The results of this study can be directly used by industry practitioners to establish best practices within the construction projects. Further research is encouraged on identifying additional components of models and testing the effectiveness of the findings with empirical data in future studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The diffusion of the circular economy (CE) paradigm in manufacturing companies, also known as Circular Manufacturing (CM), has been triggered by the intensive exploitation of natural resources and the associated negative environmental impacts generated. According to CM, natural resources consumption should be minimized, and their life cycle should be extended or reintegrated into new life cycles after usage. In this context, the digital transformation of manufacturing companies, exploiting both Industry 4.0 technologies and information systems (IS), may support them not only in their process management but also in embracing CM strategies. To take this digital and circular transformative path, the synergic exploitation of IS for CE adoption is essential. The extant literature presents scattered knowledge about the potential to exploit data collected from IS to implement CM strategies. Therefore, the research objective is to support companies in using IS to implement CM strategies, by integrating into a unique CM-IS framework. First, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the direct correlation between specific IS and CM strategies, and also the related parameters influencing a good synergy among them. Subsequently, a maturity model has been developed to provide a practical framework to assess the current state of a manufacturing company in adopting IS for CM strategies implementation. The maturity model has also been integrated with a SWOT analysis module to define a roadmap to improve the current state of the company assessed. Last, the maturity model has been applied to an industrial use case showing the benefits from IS exploitation for CM purposes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to their low importance in terms of value and because C-parts are predominantly standard items, C-parts have little strategic relevance. Therefore, economic efficiency is the overriding premise in their entire supply chain, whereby little consideration is given to ecological sustainability aspects. However, sustainable business requires a holistic approach. This makes a structured consideration of ecological sustainability aspects as implemented in several sustainability maturity models particularly important for C-parts management (CPM). However, existing research lacks maturity models geared towards CPM. Therefore, this study aims to close this gap by developing a maturity model for the evaluation of the ecological sustainability in CPM. Based on a systematic literature review, we conceptually develop a fundamental maturity model that is subsequently validated at a CPM solution provider. We identified six ecological drivers and developed a five-level evaluation matrix consisting of 30 defined maturity levels. From an academic point of view, the model serves as a valid starting point for scientific in-depth studies in sustainable CPM. Moreover, it provides managers with the opportunity to, first, assess the status quo of their sustainability in CPM, then, second to identify improvement potential, and lastly, third, allows for cross-company benchmarking. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Society 5.0 is a transformative vision for the future driven by integrating digital technologies and human-centered approaches, fusing with cyber-physical spaces to create a smart society that addresses megatrends through innovative and collaborative solutions by stakeholders. This article analyzes Maturity Models (MMs) in Higher Education to identify the components of Education 4.0 that aim to achieve Society 5.0, seeking the dimensions and levels associated with the quintuple helix and the mission of the HEIs. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) guided by research questions to highlight studies that address Maturity Models worldwide, identify components of Education 4.0 in the MM, research methods and instruments used, internal and external stakeholders, and some characteristics of the university missions. The study method employed was a Systematic Review analyzing 26 articles from 2018 to 2023 found in WoS and Scopus databases using inclusion and exclusion criteria under a Prisma workflow. The findings were that the HEIs must: a) analyze dimensions of various Education 4.0 components in a balanced way, b) incorporate comparative designs and mixed methods of the MM models, c) provide technology transfer services, training, and data centers, d) provide fully open environments to educate all citizens inclusively, and e) use sustainable MMs for a significant difference in impact. This review offers educational leaders and policymakers the methodologies for measuring the Education 4.0 path to Society 5.0. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {DevOps is welcomed by software development companies in recent years as a novel approach attached to the Agile software development methodology. Yet, they are in trouble with implementing DevOps because it doesn't just concentrate on technological changes. It alters the software development process more broadly. To assist this challenging process, DevOps maturity models have been established by a few scholars in recent years. Nevertheless, those models consist variety of drawbacks as; the majority of them have not been properly evaluated and published. This research aimed to provide a critical evaluation of the data available in existing studies on the DevOps maturity models and to propose a DevOps adoption process improvement framework that is validated by industry practitioners. To accomplish this target, a systematic literature review was applied and studied the available DevOps maturity models, weaknesses, and strengths of those models. A new framework for DevOps process improvement is developed by monitoring and contrasting the available data. Furthermore, it was assessed by an interview survey to strengthen the research's overall goal. The study presents a verified DevOps process improvement model which consists of four main DevOps success areas; DevOps practices, DevOps team, DevOps culture, and DevOps measurement. Each area follows five maturity levels starting with beginning to expert. This framework assists software development companies in obtaining benefits while reducing the difficulties associated with DevOps adoption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In recent years, several industry-specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) MMs were developed to support AI Management as part of the IT management in organizations. While the development of these AI MMs follows widely standardized procedures and therefore is sufficiently addressed in scientific discourse, a lack of attention toward their practical application can be seen. Therefore, this paper proposes a technical prototype for a generic web-based maturity assessment tool for AI management. Overall, a design science-oriented research procedure with a Systematic Literature Review, the design of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), the development of a web-based tool, and evaluations with Cognitive Walkthroughs and Personas are conducted. The results indicate that the development of a web tool is an innovative and promising way of applying AI MMs. This work contributes to the current body of knowledge in Information Systems Engineering research by providing a first technical prototype for a web-based maturity assessment tool for AI Management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Combining these two lines of investigation, it can be concluded that, in order to better prepare, adapt and make health systems more resilient, it is fundamental that future Maturity Models begin to map agility in diagnosing diseases, scale of exams, process of hospital disinfection and technological infrastructure, focusing on ICTs such as ML, LMS, DL, Robot Assistance, Actuators, Big Data, Blockchain, Smart Wearables, Delivery Drones, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Sensors and Cloud Technology. These IFs are identified as gaps for existing MMs in the sector. Allied to this, it is indicated that the future MMs consider expanding their focus in supply chain, services and applications, monitoring and, mainly, patient safety and care, given the importance that these IFs demonstrated in coping with the pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In doing so, a systematic literature review has been used to examine the existing e-government maturity models during the period 2000-2021. Our analysis indicates that despite the fact that e-government-maturity models provide potentially useful tools for e-government evaluation, there are significant differences across the existing e-government-maturity models in terms of the number of stages, what users can do at progressive stages, and particular perspectives underscored at specific stages. However, the shift from 'stage-based maturity models' to 'dimensional-based maturity models' is clearly observed. The new wave of e-government maturity models (2012 onward) sees e-government as a path for pursuing digital, resilience, equal, and inclusive societies rather than only as a mechanism to deliver e-services. Additionally, the existing e-government maturity models reached their possibilities to demonstrate the advanced maturity levels of e-government such as smart government. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cybersecurity has gained increasing importance among firms of different sizes and industries due to the significant rise of cyber-attacks over time. Technology startups are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to the lack of cyber security measures. This is because of limited human capital and financial resources to quantify cyber risks and allocate appropriate investments to cyber security. Technology startups are suppliers and vendors to large organisations such as MNCs, government and financial institutions. They could possibly have a network connection back to the large organisations and might even store confidential information of these large organisations such as financial records, personal data and other proprietary information. As such, with the lack of appropriate cyber security measures, technology startups may be an attack vector for malicious hackers to gain entry to the large organisations. Focusing on technology startups, this study conducted a systematic literature review on cyber security maturity assessment frameworks. This study addressed five research questions on the existing cyber security maturity assessment frameworks in various industries, the target for implementation, cyber security maturity level, shared control domains of these frameworks, and the quantification of the return of cyber security investments. Referring to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist, a detailed analysis was performed on 24 published research articles (out of 650) from reputable journals and conference proceedings from January 2011 to June 2022. The results revealed the lack of an end-to-end cyber security maturity assessment framework for technology startups. Despite the similarities in the cyber security maturity level for certain frameworks, the results revealed no singular framework that can evaluate the cyber security maturity level of technology startups. The results further revealed the lack of studies on the quantification of the return of cyber security investments in an end-to-end cyber security maturity assessment framework for technology startups. This put the startup in a vulnerable position since management is not able to obtain relevant data on the startup's cyber maturity posture and without such information, they are not able to appropriately justify their security investments to mitigate the evolving cyber risks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the current data-driven digital economy, organizations attempt to harness big data power to make their decisions better. The big data analytics assist them not only to identify new opportunities but extract knowledge and obtain better performance. Despite a huge investment in big data analytics initiatives, the majority of organizations have failed to successfully exploit their power. Although big data analytics have received considerable research attention, a little has been done on how organizations implement strategies in order to integrate the different dimensions of big data analytics; hence, a roadmap is required to navigate these technological initiatives. This paper is also an attempt to overcome this challenge by developing a comprehensive big data analytics maturity model to help managers evaluate their existing capabilities and formulate an appropriate strategy for further progress. A mixed-method was applied in this research using a qualitative meta-synthesis approach. For this purpose, first, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the capabilities and practices of big data analytics maturity. Then the proposed key capabilities and practices were assessed and prioritized based on the opinions of experts using the quantitative survey method. Finally, considering the architecture of the big data analytics maturity model, the capabilities were assigned to maturity levels according to their priority of implementation using a focus group. The proposed model is comprised of four main capabilities, nine key dimensions (KDs) and five maturity levels based on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI) architecture. A questionnaire and a focus group were used to present the big data maturity model. The capabilities and KDs, as well as their implementation order and weight in the proposed maturity model are presented as a roadmap for implementing big data analytics effectively. The proposed model enables organizations to assess their current big data analytics capabilities and navigate them to select appropriate strategies for their improvement. Due to its nature, it allows managers to find their strong and weak points and identify investment priorities. This study provides a comprehensive maturity model using a meta-synthesis which has not been used in this field so far. The proposed model is both descriptive and prescriptive and has a significant theoretical contribution to big data researches. The paper provides a mechanism to benchmark big data analytics projects and develop an appropriate strategy in terms of progress. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the recent decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of maturity models offered in Building Information Modelling (BIM). However, several problems exist, such as no proper criteria for model choice for organisations and no adequate understanding of BIM maturity model (BIMMM) application areas. Thus, a systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken using 32 papers published between 2010 and 2021, directed with a descriptive and content analysis, following the PRISMA standards. The results of this paper extend the knowledge on BIMMM development, application and validation. BIMMM development has always been initiated with a literature review on existing maturity models. National BIM Standard’s Interactive Capability Maturity Model is the most dominant base for developing and applying BIMMMs. However, the literature lacks applications and validation of mainstream models. The application of BIMMMs is mainly focused on assessing BIM performance, while a few studies tried to explore new avenues such as applying BIMMMs to other contexts, finding the relationship between maturity level and other factors, and understanding the impact of BIM maturity level on factors like project performance. Despite interviews and case studies being popular methods of model validation, doubts on the validity of the models have been raised due to the dearth of information on how most of the models were validated. The results of the study lead future research in the BIMMMs and inform the development and application of valid BIMMMs in practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The popularity of User Experience (UX) is exponentially mounting because it predicts users’ engagement through satisfying needs. It further determines product success, revenues augmentation, employee gratifications, user errors, and vital supports. However, contemporary UX Capability Maturity Models (UXCMMs) do not adequately address Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) UX, a substantiated root of adoption misfortune. Improving UX may result from a precise appraisal of the as-is organisational status. Although Software Engineering endorses CMMI, ISO 15504/ISO/IECTS 33061 and UXCMMs for this judgement, none has processes for evaluating FOSSs’ UX. Moreover, the FOSS community has neither theories nor hypotheses to map UXCMMs’ formulation processes. It knows very little regarding their practical applicability, which leaves functional relevance uncertainties. In retorting to present uncertainties, this study accomplished the Systematic Literature Review and encountered eight pertinent articles. They show that most UXCMMs originated from recognised models. Moreover, neither developed nor validated experimentally, used similar methodologies with patched documents and are not exclusive for the FOSS community. They neither handle challenges properly nor reflect earlier studies’ endorsements. The study’s contributions to discovered gaps include proposing additional research areas and a FOSS-specific UXCMMs development checklist to identify UX metrics and standardise UXCMMs’ development processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The adoption of off-site construction (OSC) is still uncertain although many contributions to its promotion have been made. In many studies, lean construction (LC) has been declared to be the most suitable approach to support managing OSC, but there are challenges regarding its incorporation into OSC. A maturity model (MM) has been proposed to evaluate and guide OSC adoption. However, the literature shows misunderstandings about the MM structure and how these models incorporate LC. This article aims to review maturity models (MMs) developed in the OSC field to identify benefits and deliver deep insight into their structure and the incorporation of LC. The methodology involved three steps: (i) systematic literature review (SLR) of OSC-MMs, (ii) thematic analysis to identify associations among MM benefits, OSC barriers, and LC challenges, and (iii) analysis and interpretation of results. The findings suggest that MMs developed in OSC are incipient, many of them suffer bias and have weaknesses in their structure, and LC incorporation is poor and not explicit in most OSC-MMs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Evidence from past research studies indicated that the maturity model had been used to measure safety culture in organisations. Safety Culture Maturity Model (SCMM) was the step taken by numerous organisations to attain better safety practices. This study aimed to review their approach to measure safety culture by the generative systematic literature review (SLR) approach. Guided by PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses), the systematic review was based on two main journal databases, namely Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), with two additional resources; Science Direct and EBSCO database. Accordingly, the search query efforts resulted in a total of twenty-nine (29) articles that could be analysed systematically. Most importantly, the review managed to formulate four main themes, namely maturity level development method, dimension identification, measurement tools, and publication categories. Overall, further analysis of the four themes resulted in the establishment of a total of 16 sub-themes. From the review, the studies found that each industry chooses different methods to develop or adapt the safety culture maturity measurement. The maturity measurement constructs had chosen to focus on specific requirements and objectives of the organisation and the worker's needs in their selections. In conclusion, systematic review in this current research study is limited and represented publications retrieved from only four databases, namely Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and EBSCO. Future studies are suggested to embark on more extensive search queries on other support databases to make further explorations on various methods involved in the SCMM development, evaluation, or applications across the industries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Communication is essential in any software development project, particularly those globally distributed where geographical, temporal, and cultural distance may hinder the effectiveness of communication. The challenges imposed by distance often characterize communication as still one of the main drawbacks of globally distributed projects. Therefore, establishing communication processes and practices is relevant to support a team’s work. These processes and practices need to be updated and aligned with the team’s needs. Thus, assessing and evaluating the maturity of such communication processes and practices is paramount. This article presents a Communication Maturity Model called C2M which aims to help organizations identify the maturity of communication-related aspects by providing an approach for revealing what practices need to be improved. The model is composed of 4 levels of maturity (causal, partially managed, managed and reflective) and 4 areas of maturity (people, project, organizational and engineering) which are organized into 15 maturity factors, each factor comprising a set of practices. The model has 58 practices and each has its specific objectives. The model was empirically developed and evaluated in three well-defined phases. In the conception phase, methodological procedures (Tertiary Study, Systematic Literature Review, and Interviews) were carried out in order to gather relevant information for designing the first version of the C2M model (alpha version). Then, in the refinement phase, two focus group meetings were held in two organizations in order to identify how effectively the model attends its purpose. The results led to a second version of the C2M model (beta version), analyzed by a survey with experts who assessed the representation of the third version of the C2M model—omega version (evaluation phase). All results achieved so far suggest that the model can assist in discovering the maturity level of the communication processes and practices in globally distributed projects. Future works will focus on developing a software tool to help with self-assessment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Various cloud-native databases have been emerging in recent years, but their developments are still in the primary stage. At this stage, database developers are generally confused about improving the performance of the database by applying AI technologies. The maturity model can help database developers formulate the measures and clarify the improvement path during development. However, the current maturity models are unsuitable for cloud-native databases since their architecture and resource management differ from traditional databases. Hence, we propose a maturity model for AI-empowered cloud-native databases from the perspective of resource management. We employ a systematic literature review and expert interviews to conduct the maturity model. Also, we develop an assessment tool based on the maturity model to help developers assess cloud-native databases. And we provide an assessment case to prove our maturity model. The assessment case results show that the database’s development direction conforms to the maturity model. It proves the effectiveness of the maturity model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The most critical issues are the fragmentation of healthcare data, obstacles in providing efficient research and services, lack of clinical trial reporting, high cost and mismanagement of the drug supply chain, patient data security, and fake drugs. Blockchain technology has the potential to address these criticalities as it has in build traceability mechanisms and promises new business models by enabling incentive structures. This potential of blockchain gathers a high interest in the health industry. However, the implementation of blockchain in healthcare faces various issues as well. Currently, there are no practice-oriented maturity models to improve such an implementation. In this paper, we present a roadmap to develop a maturity model for blockchain in healthcare (MMBH) based on critical barriers (CBs), critical success factors (CSFs), and the best practices for blockchain implementation in healthcare systems. As a first step to develop the MMBH, in this paper, we present the initial results of a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify critical success factors for implementing blockchain in healthcare systems. We also applied fuzzy technique order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to prioritize the identified CSFs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The need for businesses to begin to explore these options to reap the benefits of I4.0 is growing and while many larger organisations are maturing in their adoption many SMEs are not. This paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) of the tools available to organisations looking to implement I4.0. The research will focus on tools are around the areas of readiness models, maturity models and frameworks that provide detail on how to begin the journey to I4.0 implementation. The key research questions to be answered are if these tools cater to the unique needs of manufacturing SME's and the challenges they face. What sets this SLR apart from other analysis is the identification of a research gap for a detailed framework for manufacturing SMEs to implement I4.0 in an agile and sustainable way. As the manufacturing world is changing and consumers are making more informed choices about what they buy with a view towards sustainability how can I4.0 help manufacturing SMEs operate in a sustainable way whilst remaining agile to changing economic conditions.

	abstract = {Manufacturing businesses seek to increase their revenue streams through new business models. In the context of the continuing digitization of the manufacturing sector, new business models based on digital servitization offerings are at the centre of attention. However, due to the inherent complexity involved in devising such offerings and suitable business models, many companies struggle to embark on this new value-adding pathway that is not yet well understood. Current research has highlighted the general challenges and barriers faced by manufacturing businesses, along with developing tools and roadmaps for successful transition to digital servitization. However, most studies have only focused on servitization in general, omitting the specific 'digital' aspect which brings about different challenges. Accordingly, the authors first introduce the concept of digital servitization in general terms, to then discuss different types of it, along with typical barriers to entry and implementation challenges. A critical element of any digital servitization endeavor is to first assess the current state of a business, to define the desired outcome of the process, and to identify the steps and actions required to accomplish the desired end goal. This is accomplished by means of maturity models that also help in terms of benchmarking current and future state against competitors. The authors introduce the research aims and questions, the research methodology and present results from a systematic review of the literature on maturity modelling, including an overview of the maturity modelling methods encountered and their respective dimensions and levels. Finally, conclusions are drawn along with the current state of the research and future work that will be conducted. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Context: Organizations are increasingly connecting software applications using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to share data, services, functionality, and even complete business processes. However, the creation and management of APIs is non-trivial. Aspects such as traffic management, community engagement, documentation, and version management are often rushed afterthoughts. Objective: In this research, we present and evaluate a focus area maturity model for API Management (API-m-FAMM). A focus area maturity model can be used to establish the maturity level of an organization in a specific functional domain described through a number of areas. The API-m-FAMM addresses the areas Lifecycle Management, Security, Performance, Observability, Community, and Commercial. Method: The model is constructed using established methods for the design of a focus area maturity model. It is grounded in literature and practice, and was developed and evaluated through a systematic literature Review, eleven expert interviews, and five case studies at software producing organizations. Result: The model is described in detail, and its application is illustrated by six case studies. Conclusions: The evaluations are reported on, and show that the API-m-FAMM is an efficient tool for aiding organizations in gaining a better understanding of their current implementation of API management practices, and provides them with guidance towards higher levels of maturity. The detailed description of the construction of the API-m-FAMM gives researchers an example to further support the available methodologies, specifically how to combine design science research with these methodologies. Additionally, this study's unique case study design shows that maturity models can be successfully deployed in practice with minimal involvement of researchers. The focus area maturity model for API Management is maintained on www.maturitymodels.org, allowing practitioners to benefit from its useful insights. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) study to investigate the agreement on the significance of AI principles and identify the challenging factors that could negatively impact the adoption of AI ethics principles. The results reveal that the global convergence set consists of 22 ethical principles and 15 challenges. Transparency, privacy, accountability and fairness are identified as the most common AI ethics principles. Similarly, lack of ethical knowledge and vague principles are reported as the significant challenges for considering ethics in AI. The findings of this study are the preliminary inputs for proposing a maturity model that assesses the ethical capabilities of AI systems and provides best practices for further improvements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Maturity models assess the snapshot view of an organization and simultaneously guides the organization to advance on a road map towards ultimate levels of maturity. The health industry has recently embraced maturity models as a tool to improve the management of health information systems. Most electronic health information systems in Sri Lanka need assessment and monitoring and can benefit vastly by adopting maturity models. This study was conducted to modify and adopt a maturity model for public health institutions in Sri Lanka. Methods: A review of the literature was done to identify a suitable model to measure the maturity of the public health information system implementations. A Modified Delphi study was then carried out with six experts to adapt the selected maturity tool, Public Health Information Technology (PHIT) maturity index, to the Sri Lankan context. Necessary modifications to the PHIT tool were done according to the comments gathered in the Modified Delphi rounds, and the validity of the tool was established. Finally, Key Informant Interviews were carried out with nine interviewees to qualitatively validate the instrument. Results: The Public Health Information Technology maturity index developed by the University of Maryland, USA, was modified to suit the Sri Lankan context. Comments from the experts were accommodated during the initial rounds of the Modified Delphi study. It further derived the following values, indicating excellent content validity: I-CVI > 0.8 for 57 total items, S-CVI/Avg = 0.988, S-CVI/UA = 0.929 and Free-marginal kappa = 0.95. Discussion and Conclusions: Modified and validated PHIT tool can be used to measure the maturity of public health institutions in similar contexts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes the existing literature-related to data science and 183 practitioners' considerations by employing a survey-based research method. By blending the findings of this research with a well-established process capability maturity model standard, International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 330xx, and following a methodological maturity development framework, a theoretically grounded model, entitled as the data science capability maturity model (DSCMM) was developed. Findings: It was found that organizations seek a capability/maturity model standard to evaluate and improve their current data science capabilities. To close this research gap, the DSCMM is developed. It consists of six capability maturity levels and twenty-seven processes categorized under five process areas: organization, strategy management, data analytics, data governance and technology management. Originality/value: This paper validates the need for a process capability maturity model for the data science domain and develops the DSCMM by integrating literature findings and practitioners' considerations into a well-accepted process capability maturity model standard to continuously assess and improve the maturity of data science capabilities of organizations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Maturity models (MMs) have witnessed exponential increase due to their successful application in several domains. However, there is an absence of review that guides researchers in developing, applying and validating Public-Private Partnership maturity models (PPPMMs). This study examines PPPMMs, provides guidance on the topic and highlights gaps in the literature. A literature search on selected electronic databases was conducted, and the study adopted the widely accepted Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement (PRISMA). The study identified a total of four thousand six hundred and eighteen (4,618) studies, and twenty-one studies (21Nr) were rigorously selected. The results revealed PPPMMs as an emerging area of research with a low number – 21 publications since its deployment for about two (2) decades. Similarly, the findings unveiled a lack of uniformity in conceptualising the terms, dimensions used, and methodology adopted. This finding is attributed mainly to the limited use of the theoretical lens, which considerably weakens the model’s theoretical foundation and limits its potential to guide improvement. Additionally, there are more efforts in developing MMs than applying and validating them. Furthermore, there is an unbalanced focus on descriptive models over prescriptive and comparative models, which inhibit the model’s potential to guide improvement. Future work should provide a solid ground to the field using a theoretical lens and focus on prescriptive models with a strong emphasis on application and validation. This research is the first of its kind that synthesises and brings together available PPPMMs literature into one place. It also contributes to the body of knowledge by highlighting areas of research that require immediate attention to enhance the much-needed success of PPP in the post-COVID-19 era. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This ability reflects the organization’s level of project management maturity (PMM). PMM is premised on the belief that the higher the PMM level, the higher the ability to successfully deliver a project. With this in mind, the current paper aims to determine the type of organizational aspects and practices that could influence the success of PMM implementation in organizations. For this purpose, a systematic literature review (SLR) was performed on 23 articles published between 2011 and 2021 that studied PMM. The findings showed that most articles stressed organizational culture and integration with strategic organizational initiatives. Among all the studied industries, the information technology industry stood out. Content analysis was used for analyzing data, which were thematized using ATLAS.ti. Ten sub-themes emerged, with six sub-themes under organizational aspects and four sub-themes under organizational practices. These sub-themes, which were intertwined with the implementation and growth of PMM in organizations, positively impact project delivery performance. Based on this, several future research opportunities were proposed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

From primary studies, we extracted 26 test automation best practices (e.g., Define an effective test automation strategy, Set up good test environments, and Develop high-quality test scripts) and collected many pieces of advice (e.g., in forms of implementation/improvement approaches, technical techniques, concepts, and experience-based heuristics) on how to conduct these best practices. We made main observations: (1) There are only six best practices whose positive effect on maturity improvement have been evaluated by academic studies using formal empirical methods; (2) several technical related best practices in this MLR were not presented in test maturity models; (3) some best practices can be linked to success factors and maturity impediments proposed by other scholars; (4) most pieces of advice on how to conduct proposed best practices were identified from experience studies and their effectiveness need to be further evaluated with cross-site empirical evidence using formal empirical methods; (5) in the literature, some advice on how to conduct certain best practices are conflicting, and some advice on how to conduct certain best practices still need further qualitative analysis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on (1) a systematic review of literature on assessing I-AI-related technologies to identify relevant measured indicators in the maturity model, and (2) semi-structured interviews with domain experts to determine maturity levels of the established model. Findings: The I-AI maturity model developed in this study includes two main dimensions, namely “Industry” and “Artificial Intelligence”, together with 12 first-level indicators and 35 second-level indicators under these dimensions. The maturity levels are divided into five types: planning level, specification level, integration level, optimization level, and leading level. Originality/value: The maturity model integrates indicators that can be used to assess AI-related technologies and extend the existing maturity models of smart manufacturing by adding specific technical and nontechnical capabilities of these technologies applied in the industrial context. The integration of the industry and artificial intelligence dimensions with the maturity levels shows a road map to improve the capability of applying AI-related technologies throughout the product lifecycle for achieving smart manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To optimize digital health outcomes, a strategic approach is necessary, requiring digital maturity assessments. However, current approaches to assessing digital maturity have been largely insufficient, with uncertainty surrounding the dimensions to assess. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the current dimensions used to assess the digital maturity of hospitals. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted of peer-reviewed literature (published before December 2020) investigating maturity models used to assess the digital maturity of hospitals. A total of 29 relevant articles were retrieved, representing 27 distinct maturity models. The articles were inductively analyzed, and the maturity model dimensions were extracted and consolidated into a maturity model framework. Results: The consolidated maturity model framework consisted of 7 dimensions: strategy; information technology capability; interoperability; governance and management; patient-centered care; people, skills, and behavior; and data analytics. These 7 dimensions can be evaluated based on 24 respective indicators. Conclusions: The maturity model framework developed for this study can be used to assess digital maturity and identify areas for improvement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we offer that panoramic view through a systematic literature review. The number of papers devoted to Industry 4.0 assessment grows steadily. However, many papers do not provide essential information about the assessment campaigns they report, e.g., not detailing the number, type, or location of companies involved and the questionnaire employed. We observe a large diffusion in Europe and Asia but not in the U.S., with the Top 5 countries being Malaysia, Poland, Italy, Germany and Slovakia. The campaigns uniformly cover small, medium, and large companies but not all industrial sectors. The choice of questionnaires is extremely varied, with no standard emerging. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To get the potential gains of DevOps, the software development industry considering global software development (GSD) environment to hire skilled human resources and round-the-clock working hours. However, due to the lack of frequent communication and coordination in GSD, the planning and managing of the requirements change process becomes a challenging task. As in DevOps, requirements are not only shaped by development feedback but also by the operations team. This means requirements affect development, development affects operations and operations affect requirements. However, DevOps in GSD still faces many challenges in terms of requirement management. The purpose of this research project is to develop a DevOps requirement change management and implementation maturity model (DevOps-RCMIMM) that could assist the GSD organizations in modifying and improving their requirement management process in the DevOps process. The development of DevOps-RCMIMM will be based on the existing DevOps and RCM literature, industrial empirical study, and understanding of factors that could impact the implementation of the DevOps requirement change management process in the domain of GSD. This vision study presents the initial results of a systematic literature review that will contribute to the development of maturity levels of the proposed DevOps-RCMIMM. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to an increasing amount of software and electronics, future technical systems will be significantly more capable than current ones, but also more complex. This increase in complexity leads to growing challenges in the context of product development. In industry, Systems Engineering (SE) is seen as a promising development approach to handle these challenges. However, despite great efforts in some cases, companies struggle with a variety of challenges when introducing SE. This paper presents an approach to facilitate the introduction of SE especially for small and medium-sized companies. For this purpose, we have developed a maturity-based implementation strategy. This strategy enables companies to determine their status and to derive strategic goals regarding their SE capability. As a first step, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to evaluate the current state of the art of SE based maturity models. We found four relevant approaches, which only cover partial areas of the introduction of SE. Subsequently, we present our approach, which was developed within a research project. In this model, the SE maturity level is determined in 3 assessment dimensions with the help of 20 action areas. Our approach is characterized in particular by an additional info box. It provides the evaluators with additional information and reflection questions for each action area to simplify the evaluation. Finally, we validate the maturity model with an industrial company. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Research related to Smart Tourism Destinations (STDs) and the technology that supports them has gained popularity and has received special attention in the last ten years. STDs show that various technologies are applied to a tourist destination, one of which aims to increase added value for the surrounding community and tourists. This study employs the systematic literature review (SLR) method to investigate smart tourism destinations and governance topics. This research aims to identify and analyze the main components of Smart Tourism Destinations Governance. Two research questions were developed and incorporated into the search term. This research resulted in 24 research papers on smart tourism destinations and governance. The result of this study is a proposed IT Governance Model, which can be a guideline for tourism's DMOs (Destination Management Organizations), tourism enterprises, IT companies that support smart tourism concepts, and policymakers (government) to improve their service to society/community. The model can be used as a guide to governing the IT implementation in smart tourism destinations projects. Limitations of this study regarding the scalability of database and keyword usage and their methodologies. Theoretical implication for scholars in the next research is that research can be conducted on how to implement this model and whether this model can be easily adopted.

	abstract = {Digital technologies foster organizations to rethink their business models and socio-technical structures. Thus, digital transformation (DT) has become a compelling priority on organizations’ agendas. To meet the new environment, well-considered actions must be initiated and monitored at the operational and strategic levels. Therefore, it requires an understanding of fields of action and possible trajectories of DT within different organizational dimensions. For this purpose, practitioners and academics have designed numerous digital maturity models to keep track of DT progress. Still, most models reveal an incomplete picture of the holistic and socio-technical nature of DT and organizations. This motivates us to answer: Which set of organizational dimensions and characteristics maps the holistic and socio-technical nature of DT in organizations? With a systematic literature review and a Delphi study, our paper aims to identify and validate relevant DT-related dimensions and characteristics. The result is a socio-technical framework that serves as a pattern for (re)designing digital maturity models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A maturity model is critical in analysing an entity as it evaluates the current situation and provides insights on enhancing the capabilities to reach higher maturity. Maturity models are being used in many industries and proven to have a positive impact on organisational development. Definition of a context specific maturity model is vital as it brings clarity to the model identification and better understanding relevant for a respective industry. Even though several construction maturity models exist, a clear and a comprehensive definition is not noticeable. A comprehensive definition for maturity models in construction sector would assist industry stakeholders to understand the components and key areas of construction maturity. Consequently, it would provide accurate and impactful results for construction firms to achieve higher maturity levels. Thus, the main aim of this paper is to establish a new definition for construction maturity models. In the process, the methodology included a systematic literature review adopting PRISMA literature review method and a content analysis using thematic analysis. The study analysed fifteen construction maturity models and identified nine overarching themes which were fundamental in developing the definition. The proposed definition would facilitate a better understanding among end users of construction maturity models, and it would assist the readers to distinguish it from other various models. Therefore, the derived definition would promote application of the concept of construction maturity in the industry. Further research could be conducted for diverse types of construction to enhance the effectiveness of the maturity models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The outcome is an updated list of security challenges and practices for DevOps software development. Both reviews shows that the most essential challenges for the DevOps security deal with the complexity of the development pipelines and the overall complexity of the cloud and microservice environments. The security activities identified were classified by using the BSIMM maturity model for software security as a framework. Our review shows that DevOps security research focuses mostly on deployment phase and technical aspects of software security.

	abstract = {Digital Twins represent a powerful tool for transforming production and logistics towards Industry 4.0. They mirror physical assets in the digital world, enriching them with additional capabilities and features such as decision-making or lifecycle management. Due to the diverse possibilities associated with the Digital Twin, their design and implementation are also wide-ranging. This paper aims to contribute to the formalization and standardization of the description of Digital Twins. It presents a method for evaluating them through their lifecycle, from design to operation. The paper is based on an overview of their potential functionalities and properties with ranked stages of development. This method allows for an application-specific evaluation of Digital Twins and describes how they can be improved to suit the application better. The maturity model development follows the procedure for developing maturity models for IT management. Relevant capabilities and features were identified with a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines. The results of this review were ranked and categorized and constitute the core of the maturity model, which was validated on five use-cases from different domains in production and logistics. The maturity model assesses Digita Twins in seven categories (context, data, computing capabilities, model, integration, control, human-machine interface) with 31 ranked characteristics. It evaluates existing solutions for potential improvements for a given application or the transfer to a new use-case. The resulting method and a supplementary web service present a generalized model for the evaluation of Digital Twins. Based on a description of a potential application, this is the first step towards a systematic evaluation, improving the structured development of such applications © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The digital economy brings us a wide range of services and products assisted by emerging technologies in Industry 4.0. Nevertheless, already since the 1990s and early 2000s, IT has had a huge impact on the digitalization and digitization of businesses. This phenomenon of advancing in digital-oriented work practices is not only affecting the customer side, but is also changing the way of working within organizations. Although employees are one of the crucial elements in each organization and their level of work satisfaction is critical to the efficiency of a business, their work impression is still undergoing scrutiny when it gets to digital process innovations. Moreover, organizations still benefit from assistance in their adoption of digital-oriented work practices, for which a related maturity model (MM) can be one of the solutions. The current Ph.D. plan consists of three research projects that follow a mixed-method approach with a combination of quantitative and qualitative designs, within an overall design of Design-Science Research (DSR). Project 1 has two subprojects (i.e., a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and a data-driven analysis). It starts with analyzing the relevant literature from a people–process–technology (PPT) perspective to extract relevant factors when digitalizing business processes. Afterwards, it investigates a representative set of European employee data using statistical data analysis (e.g., factor analysis and ANOVA) and data mining (e.g., clustering) techniques to delve into the impact of digital-oriented work practices on work satisfaction. After this artefact identification, we continue with Project 2 (i.e., expert panel, case study) to add evidence for a maturity-based gradation along with the identified clusters of digital-oriented work practices. Finally, Project 3 helps concretize the intended MM by focusing on the relationships with employee satisfaction and the relevant factors. Our findings will assist organizations to upgrade their work practices (i.e., including assessment and improvement advice), while simultaneously empowering their employees. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to develop a systematic method called servitization maturity model to support companies in developing distinctive capabilities for successful servitization. Design/methodology/approach: The concept of maturity models is adopted to support companies in developing distinctive capabilities for servitization. A systematic literature review and case study approach are employed to develop the maturity model. Findings: The findings highlight 46 capabilities classified into seven categories: strategy and leadership, performance, offerings, customers, organization, network and digital technology. Furthermore, the evolutionary path is defined by combining two types of levels, i.e. capability and maturity levels, to develop these capabilities. Research limitations/implications: The evolutionary path was partially validated through the application, while further investigation is required to validate the evolutionary path. Therefore, future research should investigate the further validation of the evolutionary path by conducting multiple case studies. Practical implications: The proposed maturity model enables companies to not only capture the bigger picture of the required capabilities without oversight, but also determine a process for improving the requisite capabilities with feasible efforts. Originality/value: Existing maturity models focused on the transition from less to more advanced services. However, recent studies emphasized that companies need to determine strategies that reflect their capabilities rather than simply move toward more advanced services. Based on this assumption, this study provides successive stages that enable companies to improve their capabilities through feasible efforts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Goal: The purpose of this paper is to present an S&OP meta-framework that combines specific S&OP tools and an original S&OP maturity model as an approach to reduce uncertainty and increase commitment in the S&OP implementation process. Design / Methodology / Approach: A systematic review led to the development of a six-pillar S&OP tool framework. Then, a maturity model and an S&OP implementation meta-framework, were defined for managing the introduction and evolution of S&OP dimensions. Results: The S&OP maturity model provides a structured model for identifing critical gaps in the S&OP process. Furthermore, the S&OP meta-framework-combining Action Research (AR), Kotter’s 8 steps, and agile project management approaches-provides an holistic implementation guide for promoting large-scale transformation in S&OP implementation efforts. Limitations of the investigation: The S&OP maturity model and implementation system are new empirical contributions to the literature and have not been validated in this article. Practical implications: This work provides a set of tools to address specific S&OP environments; a maturity model to diagnose the S&OP process; and an S&OP implementation framework to reduce uncertainty and increase commitment in the change process. Originality / Value: This article fills a literature gap of necessary S&OP implementation practices, contributing to: (1) an S&OP tools framework, (2) an S&OP maturity model based on evolutionary boundaries correlated to the presence of specific tools, processes and metrics, and (3) an S&OP implementation meta-framework, raising awareness in under researched S&OP dimensions for more oriented research and practices needed to promote sustainable change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {(1) Shared decision making (SDM) has been advocated as a way of improving prudency in healthcare and has been linked to self-efficacy and empowerment of service users. The evaluation of its use in musculoskeletal (MSK) physiotherapy has been vague, but articles suggest that trust and communication are integral. (2) ENTREQ guidelines informed this systematic review and thematic synthesis. PRISMA recommendations steered a systematic literature search of AHMED, CINAHL, MEDLNE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from inception to September 2021. COREQ was used for quality appraisal of articles alongside critical discussions. Analysis and synthesis included five stages: outlining study characteristics, coding of data, development of descriptive themes, development of analytical themes and integration and refinement. The review aim was to explore people’s experiences of SDM in MSK physiotherapy and to inform our understanding of the conditions needed for successful SDM. (3) Out of 1508 studies, 9 articles were included. Four main themes (trust, communication, decision preferences and decision ability) demonstrated that the majority of people want to participate in decision-making. As described in the capacity and capability model, three core conditions were needed to facilitate someone’s’ ability to participate. (4) People want to be involved in SDM in MSK physiotherapy. For successful SDM, physiotherapists should look to develop mutual trust, utilise two-way communication and share power. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Although companies are aware of its potential benefits, they face challenges creating a clear roadmap to reform their existing processes in line with these technologies. Maturity models are developed to assist organisations by providing extensive guidance and a roadmap for improvement. However, as a result of the systematic literature review and its analysis, it was observed that none of the 18 existing maturity models in the digital transformation domain fully satisfies all the criteria of suitability, completeness, clearness, and objectivity. To close this research gap, this study aims to develop a holistic maturity model in the digital transformation domain, entitled DX-CMM, by applying a theoretically grounded development approach, which has so far been neglected despite its remarkable relevance. The purpose of DX-CMM is to assist organisations by providing current capability and maturity determination, deriving a gap analysis, and creating a comprehensive roadmap for improvement in a standardised way. An exploratory case study is also conducted to check the applicability of the model in this study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Then, we analysed with more detail the practical application studies which were further divided into three main categories of the Gartner analytical maturity model, Descriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics. In particular, we characterized the distinct analytics studies in terms of the industry application and data context used, impact (in terms of their Technology Readiness Level) and selected data modelling method.

	abstract = {The main purpose of the article is to identify the factors limiting the achievement of higher levels of maturity in the implementation of process orientation elements on the example of automotive sector organizations in Norway. The study uses a systematic review of the literature and opinion poll carried out using the CAWI technique of 48 car dealerships functioning on the Norwegian automotive market. In the surveyed group of automotive sector organizations in Norway, based on the proprietary maturity model, it was shown that most of these are organizations in which business processes are only identified and formalized. The group of factors that prevent the achievement of higher levels of maturity includes the lack of process measurement systems, the lack of employee activation in process improvement, the lack of implementation of the customer-supplier relationship mechanism in external and internal terms, and deficiencies in the management of knowledge diffusion within the organization. The presented results have been formulated for the examined group of 48 organizations and they cannot be extended to the entire population of authorized services. The theoretical model presented in the article, as well as the attached questionnaire for assessing the implementation of process orientation, enables self-assessment of the process maturity for organizations operating in the automotive sector, both at the dealership level, as well as manufacturers and importers managing the dealership network. It is also a source of knowledge regarding the functioning of the examined dealership group in the selected market, primarily from the perspective of assessing the orientation of external and internal customers and the flexibility of the organization in responding to changes generated both in the environment and its interior. The theoretical model presented in the article is an innovative approach in assessing the level of the organization's process orientation implementation on the basis of an objectified and not subjective assessment of the respondents. In addition, the assessment model presented in the article was adapter to the specifics of the studied organizations of the automotive sector, which definitely increases the credibility of the obtained results in contrast to the use of universal models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The adoption of continuous software engineering practices such as DevOps (Development and Operations) in business operations has contributed to significantly shorter software development and deployment cycles. Recently, the term MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) has gained increasing interest as a practice that brings together data scientists and operations teams. However, the adoption of MLOps in practice is still in its infancy and there are few common guidelines on how to effectively integrate it into existing software development practices. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review and a grey literature review to derive a framework that identifies the activities involved in the adoption of MLOps and the stages in which companies evolve as they become more mature and advanced. We validate this framework in three case companies and show how they have managed to adopt and integrate MLOps in their large-scale software development companies. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we review contemporary literature to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in MLOps. Based on this review, we derive an MLOps framework that details the activities involved in the continuous development of machine learning models. Second, we present a maturity model in which we outline the different stages that companies go through in evolving their MLOps practices. Third, we validate our framework in three embedded systems case companies and map the companies to the stages in the maturity model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Additionally, in early 2020, the Association for Talent Development (ATD) globally launched their new Talent Development Capability Model. To determine how instructional design is operationalized in various industries, we utilized the Talent Development Capability Model as a framework to review 100 online job postings from LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and HigherEdJobs.com, scanning each for the 23 capabilities identified in the ATD Talent Development Capability Model. Using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) organizational framework as our method of reviewing job postings, we found that instructional design, talent delivery and facilitation, technology application, communication, and collaboration and leadership capabilities appeared the most frequently. Educational requirements were statistically significantly associated with job sectors, as shown in our analysis. With these results and analysis, this research will inform both formal instructional design education programs and job seekers regarding how instructional design is operationalized in job requisitions.

To make this path much feasible for companies in this industry, Maturity Models (MMs) are very useful tools in achieving this following their use in evaluation of the initial state of a company for planned development journey towards Industry 4.0 (I4.0) readiness and implementation. Study shows that only a limited number of O&G specific roadmaps, MMs, frameworks and readiness assessments are available today. This paper aims to review the currently available Industry 4.0 MMs for manufacturing industries and analyze their applicability in the O&G upstream sector using the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, recognizing the specific requirements of this industry. The study looks at the key characteristic for O&G sector in relation to the manufacturing sector and identifies research gaps needed to be addressed to successfully support the O&G sector in readiness for Industry 4.0 implementation. An Industry 4.0 maturity model that reflects the industrial realities for the O&G upstream sector more accurately from insights drawn from the reviews of existing MMs is proposed. This reduces the challenges of the transition process towards Industry 4.0 and provides support for the critical change desired for improved efficiency in the sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Lean manufacturing (LM) has advocated gains by reducing waste and intensifying continuous improvement. As a holistic organizational policy, it must overpass the limits of the manufacturing function. Management accounting should be aligned to lean thinking, aiming to meet the demands and goals of a lean organization. This paper aims to investigate the degree of alignment between management accounting systems and LM practices. Design/methodology/approach: Two representative case studies were carried out in industry leaders in the implementation of LM, in Brazil. The key research constructs and were identified by means of a systematic literature review. The rhetoric and practice concerning the alignment between management accounting and LM are discussed based on the existing theory and the conducted case studies. Findings: The analysis showed that many of the principles that form the rhetoric of lean accounting are far from the accounting practices observed in the companies. Using the theory-building function of case studies, 10 propositions to be tested in future research are proposed. The main propositions are also summarized in a framework based on analogies with optical lenses. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, there are no previous in-depth studies focusing on characterizing this alignment between management accounting and LM practices. The analysis yields prescriptive directions for managers that seek to improve this alignment in their business. This study also proposes a five-stage maturity model, which can be used by the managers to assess this alignment and to set goals for reaching more advanced levels of maturity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The introduction of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) brings benefits to the industries and our daily life. Innovation such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and blockchain is not only confined to the manufacturing industry but covers the whole of human life. Notwithstanding the said innovation, it also gives rise to cybercrimes with these technologies’ assistance. The botnet called Mirai is one example of compromising the technology in IR 4.0 to launch large-scale cyberattacks through Internet access. It is therefore crucial for the digital forensic (DF) organization to be ready to handle this kind of incident. This paper aims to provide the indicators for DF organizations’ maturity and readiness in the era of IR 4.0. To establish the indicators, a systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted. It involves four phases in the SLR, where the focus is; (1) challenges of DF in IR 4.0, (2) chain of custody and DF readiness, (3) existing maturity model, and (4) benchmarking the maturity element, respectively. It covers the research studies taken from five databases. From the comparison analysis, this study has derived five indicators for the maturity and readiness of DF organization: (1) People and capacity development, (2) Organization, policy and cooperation, (3) Process, (4) Technology and technical, (5) Legislation and regulation. Finally the work outlines the DF practices based on the CMMI ver. 2 practice areas and potential governance and management objectives that can govern the DF organization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The success of disaster management efforts demands meaningful integration of data that is geographically dispersed and owned by stakeholders in various sectors. However, the difficulty in finding, accessing and reusing interoperable vocabularies to organise disaster management data creates a challenge for collaboration among stakeholders in the disaster management cycle on data integration tasks. Thus the need to implement FAIR principles that describe the desired features ontologies should possess to maximize sharing and reuse by humans and machines. In this review, we explore the extent to which sharing and reuse of disaster management knowledge in the domain is inline with FAIR recommendations. We achieve this through a systematic search and review of publications in the disaster management domain based on a predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We then extract social-technical features in selected studies and evaluate retrieved ontologies against the FAIR maturity model for semantic artefacts. Results reveal that low numbers of ontologies representing disaster management knowledge are resolvable via URIs. Moreover, 90.9% of URIs to the downloadable disaster management ontology artefacts do not conform to the principle of uniqueness and persistence. Also, only 1.4% of all retrieved ontologies are published in semantic repositories and 84.1% are not published at all because there are no repositories dedicated to archiving disaster domain knowledge. Therefore, there exists a very low level of Findability (1.8%) or Accessibility (5.8%), while Interoperability and Reusability are moderate (49.1% and 30.2 % respectively). The low adherence of disaster vocabularies to FAIR Principles poses a challenge to disaster data integration tasks because of the limited ability to reuse previous knowledge during disaster management phases. By using FAIR indicators to evaluate the maturity in sharing, discovery and integration of disaster management ontologies, we reveal potential research opportunities for managing reusable and evolving knowledge in the disaster community. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recently, Agile Development has emerged as an alternative approach in software engineering. The Agile Software Development (ASD) process provides the ability to cope with ever-changing requirements. On the other hand, the Capability Maturity Model Integration, one of the Software Process Improvement Framework, is widely used to provide software development organizations with structure and stability in their software process. It enables organizations to generate software processes with better quality software, the productivity increase of the development team, and minimal risk of failure. The idea behind combining the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Agile aims to create a software development procedure that is stable and continues to improve while also providing agility for dealing with dynamic business needs. This research compiles the experiences of combining both software and identifies challenges for the collaborative implementation process. This study also highlights the extent of the compatibility of CMMI and Agile Development. This research followed a standardized Systematic Literature Review procedure and used the approach known as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses or PRISMA. The findings indicate that the main challenges with regard to combining CMMI and Agile are the lack of relevant knowledge and experience and the culture of CMMI, Agile, or sometimes both. The limited scope of Agile itself poses another considerable challenge. Agile focuses on software development projects, while CMMI has a broader range, from project-level development to organization-level process improvement. This review also finds that Agile Development is compatible with CMMI at a maturity level of 2 and 3. Future studies should determine the optimal method for overcoming the obstacles associated with combining CMMI and Agile. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The European Green Deal aims to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. According to this ambitious plan, 50% of greenhouse gas emissions are to be saved through a wide implementation of a circular economy. With supply chains responsible for four-fifths of greenhouse gas emissions, their role in the transition from linearity to a circular economy, and thus in the successful implementation of circular systems, is critical and requires the attention of academia, policymakers, and practitioners. Maturity models are suitable for monitoring, assessing, and evaluating the transformation process and determining the status quo of a supply chain. However, as the implementation of circular supply chains is still in its infancy, circular maturity frameworks at the supply chain level are not available yet. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to conceptualize a framework for analyzing the maturity level of circular economy adoption in the supply chain context. From an extensive and systematic literature review of overall 1,372 articles on supply chains, circular economy and maturity the following findings can be drawn: (i) circular economy and circular supply chains are massively growing research streams; (ii) the link between circular economy, supply chains and maturity assessment is so far missing; (iii) three constructs (organization, products, processes) characterize and influence circular supply chain maturity; (iv) a 3-layered maturity grid covering six archetypal elements of the circular economy enables the assessment of a circular supply chain maturity. The developed circular supply chain maturity framework paves the way for circular economy adoption at supply chain level by understanding current level of circular maturity and thus supporting the circular economy implementation process at supply chain level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are most affected by turbulent environments as they usually face cost restrains and difficulties in accessing qualified experts. Pushed by the COVID-19 outbreak, governments implemented a complete or partial “lockdown” in many countries. This situation disrupted the business environment, touching more dramatically SMEs. To cope with these challenges, working and collaborating remotely has become the new normal, and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) a necessity, accelerating the process of Digital Transformation. Enterprise Social Media (ESM) describes ICT tools with the potential to affect the organizational context and structure, as they encompass all distinct capabilities of social media, adapted for the working environment, supporting communication, collaboration, innovation, and efficiency. To benefit from the ESM use imposed by the pandemic context, SMEs need guidance and parameters to evaluate and develop their ESM initiatives. Literature suggests that maturity models are relevant for supporting organizations in these types of challenges. However, maturity models focusing on the socio-technical characteristics of this transformation and the internal and external contingencies of SMEs are rare. By performing a systematic literature review about the existing maturity models for general-purpose social media through the lens of the contingency theory and considering the social-technical perspective of this phenomenon, the objective of this paper is to reduce this gap, by proposing a maturity model adapted to the context of Digital Transformation and SMEs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This review is completed with the purpose to build, in a later stage of the project, a model to assess the digital maturity of the service provider companies in Colombia. To develop this systematic review, the scientific databases of Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, and EBSCO were consulted. After applying some exclusion filters, 23 maturity models designed for service provider companies were identified, and they were compared with the enterprise architecture layers proposed by ArchiMate 3.0.1. As a result, it was concluded that the digital strategy and the business model layers are the most considered ones in the maturity models; on the other hand, the implementation and migration layer is only included by one of the analyzed models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Organizations in various industries have widely developed the artificial intelligence (AI) maturity model as a systematic approach. This study aims to review state-of-theart studies related to AI maturity models systematically. It allows a deeper understanding of the methodological issues relevant to maturity models, especially in terms of the objectives, methods employed to develop and validate the models, and the scope and characteristics of maturity model development. Our analysis reveals that most works concentrate on developing maturity models with or without their empirical validation. It shows that the most significant proportion of models were designed for specific domains and purposes. Maturity model development typically uses a bottom-up design approach, and most of the models have a descriptive characteristic. Besides that, maturity grid and continuous representation with five levels are currently trending in maturity model development. Six out of 13 studies (46%) on AI maturity pertain to assess the technology aspect, even in specific domains. It confirms that organizations still require an improvement in their AI capability and in strengthening AI maturity. This review provides an essential contribution to the evolution of organizations using AI to explain the concepts, approaches, and elements of maturity models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of Agile in the software development industry in the past two decades revealed that it is lackluster in some aspects, such as in guaranteeing user involvement and assuring that the right software is being built. There are reports that combining Agile with Lean Startup and User-Centered Design (UCD) helps in overcoming these shortcomings while also yielding several other benefits. However, there is not much documentation on how to use this “combined approach” and adapting existing organizations to use it is a challenge in of itself, in which the use of an instrument to guide or assess such transformations is typically pivotal to their success. As such, in this paper we seek to identify maturity models that assess the use of Agile, Lean Startup, and UCD. We conducted a systematic literature review of maturity models for these three methods published between 2001 and 2020. We characterized the maturity models and determined how they see maturity, how they are applied, and how they were evaluated. As an extended version of a previous paper, we augmented our analysis criteria and further classified the models in how they interpret maturity and what strategy they suggest when undergoing an improvement process, in addition to providing new insight on various aspects of the models. We found 35 maturity models, of which 23 were for Agile, 5 for Lean thinking, 5 for UCD, and 2 for Agile and UCD combined. No models for the combination of the three methods were found (nor for Lean Startup), as expected due to the novelty of the approach. Existing models mostly focus on practice adoption and acquiring continuous improvement capabilities, and are typically developed with a specific context in mind. We also note a lack of proper evaluation procedures being conducted on the majority of models, which could be due to the lack of well-established maturity model development methods and guidelines. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Agile methods are extensively adapted by software development organizations due to the competitive benefits it offers. In recent years global software development (GSD) projects practice agile methods as prominent methods to deliver the software in increments with utmost user satisfaction and affordable cost. Beside the use of agile methods, the software industry has also considered the green aspect of software, to be in line with the demands of the organizations and the world technological ecosystem. The green and sustainable feature of software should focus both the energy and resource efficiency key factors. This phenomenon of embedding the green flavor in software has emerged a new research area, green software engineering, that promises the development of eco-friendly software with minimum energy and use of less computing resources, to trim down the adverse effects on both society and environment. The principal objective of this research study is to design and develop a multi-level Green-Agile Maturity Model (GAMM) to assess the GSD vendors' agile maturity in terms of green software development. The model has been built in four phases. In phase I and II, systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to identify the success factors and risk factors that either supports or hinders the green and sustainable software development respectively by practicing the agile methods in GSD. The results have been validated from 106 relevant experts, dealing with agile and green software projects, through questionnaire survey. The experts' demographic represents 25 different countries. We also identified the industry practices through SLR and survey, to address our identified critical factors. Phase III of this research deals with development of the GAMM by categorizing the identified factors into seven Green-Agile maturity levels. A similar approach has been used in other models such as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Implementation Maturity Model (IMM) and Software Outsourcing Vendors Readiness Model (SOVRM). In phase IV of this research, five case studies were conducted at GSD organizations, to evaluate the structure and efficacy of the GAMM, while as a major contribution, this paper presents our developed model, the GAMM, which aims to assess the green-agile maturity of the GSD vendors in terms of green and sustainable software development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Thereby, the maturity model is an effective tool to assess the current capabilities and the future needs of an organization, process, or group. This study had two phases. The first phase identified the core literature on maturity models for library services and management. The second evaluated the specifications of the maturity models employed or derived for library services and management. A total of 12 maturity models were selected for the study. The selected models were reviewed based on 18 parameters, out of which nine were adopted from the literature study, and the authors identified nine others. These parameters were classified based on descriptive, structural, and administrative attributes of the models. The parameters help to identify the most appropriate maturity model for implementing it in a library or information center. Results show that several domain-specific free and commercial maturity models can improve the library and information services. Library and information professionals should utilize the opportunity available in user training and community support for maturity models to foster information services. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In an era where new concepts and techniques are introduced continuously, there is a lack of systematic literature review (SLR) on identifying main dimensions, levels, methods to assess the maturity and readiness level toward I4.0. To address this gap, we have chosen our primary objective to provide a critical review of existing literature on dimensions, methods, levels, and current trends to evaluate the I4.0 maturity and readiness models. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology was adopted to make sure that there is no replication and to maintain complete transparency in the review process. A total of 53 papers were deemed relevant for thematic analysis. From the literature, we have found and proposed 10 main dimensions - Strategy and Organization, Manufacturing and Operations, Supply Chain, Business Model, IT, People, Customers, Product, Services, and Culture, to assess the I4.0 maturity and readiness levels of an organization. Further, a conceptual framework was proposed for the same. This study contributes theoretically to the development of I4.0 maturity and readiness models. So far, this is the first review paper on dimensions of I4.0 maturity and readiness models and is expected to give future researchers and practitioners a holistic guideline to design and develop I4.0 maturity and readiness models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It is valuable for evaluations and continuous improvement of business processes or certain aspects of organizations, as it represents a more organized and systematic way of doing business. In this paper, we only focus on college higher education. For this reason, we present a novel approach that allows detecting some gaps in the existing maturity models for universities, as they are not models that address the dimensions in their entirety. To identify these models and their validities, as well as a classification of models that were identified in universities, we carried out a systematic literature review on 27,289 articles retrieved with respect to maturity models and published in peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2020. We found 23 articles that find maturity models applied in universities, through exclusion and inclusion criteria. We then grouped these items into nine categories with specific purposes. We concluded that maturity models used in Universities move towards agility, which is supported by the semantic web. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Indonesia is facing a number of independently managed challenges related to the collection, transportation, processing (composting, recycling), and landfill dependence on waste management. An intervention is needed to bring stakeholders together to solve these waste challenges. The objectives of this study are to investigate the fundamental issues and opportunities and to develop a sustainable and smart country-wide waste management system using industry 4.0 technologies. The system should provide a multi-dimensional approach, determine the maturity level of the waste management system in a technical method, and pursue the goal of designing a new strategy to minimise waste management problems. A comprehensive systematic literature review, intensive focus group discussions, and direct observation in Indonesian cities were approaches used to develop waste management business processes and their system design. Waste business processes consist of mixed-collecting, sorting, transporting, varied-treatment, and chained-disposal. The design of the proposed waste management system presents circular economy processes that can separate municipal waste, identify waste characteristics, and determine sustainable waste treatment technologies through the use of Internet of Thing (IoT) as the integrator. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Good health, and wellbeing (SDG 3); Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13).

In fact, in the past decade, many secruity maturity models are still being produced and remain unproven regardless of the existence of ISO 21827. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have used the systematic literature review to summarize existing research, help identify gaps in the existing literature and provide background for positioning new research studies. Findings: The authors highlighted the prevalent influence of the ISO/IEC 27001/27002 standard but raised the necessity for an in-depth investigation of ISO 21827. The authors also made the implementation facet a central topic of our review. The authors found out that, compared to the number of proposed models, implementation experiments are lacking. This could be due to the arduous task of validation and it could also be the reason why specific models are dominant. Originality/value: While the research literature contains many experience reports and a few case studies on information security maturity evaluation, a systematic review and synthesis of this growing field of research is unavailable as far as the authors know.

	abstract = {The adoption and structuring of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is currently one of the main goals of many Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) companies, but this scenario is still vulnerable due to the numerous simultaneous challenges related to technology, processes and culture. This promotes a sometimes wordy environment when developing the fundamental goal, definitions, steps, and attack plans for implementing BIM. Due to these circumstances, this study proposes an approach to assess readiness and maturity models aligned with the organization's strategic perspectives, discussing aspects of performance, applicability and usability. This work was developed from a systematic literature review of maturity models in 4 databases based on the ProKnow-C method. Its bibliometric analysis resulted in the selection of 23 articles, in which it was possible to evaluate 22 BIM maturity models and analyze them according to the structure of basic design principles supported by a descriptive and prescriptive purpose of use. Therefore, it is hoped that this research will allow companies in a simplified way to identify the maturity model that best fits the stage of the building's lifecycle in which it is inserted, supporting it in assessment as a contribution to the beginning of the digital transformation journey. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data analytics have become a trending research topic since the last decade given its importance in the organizational decision-making process. Several organizations are trying to employ data in improving their decision making and strategies. Although data scientists and business intelligence consultants are hired to make beneficial use of these data, their activities are not enough for making the organization a data-driven one. The data-driven organizations are not defined by their technical tools, but by their culture, core processes, and capabilities. Organizations and consultants use maturity models as a tool to assess the current situation and optimization of the processes. The first maturity model developed in 1988 was named Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and was used for assessing the ability of government contractors' processes to implement a contracted software project in the USA. Afterward, numerous maturity models were developed in many different domains. Data Maturity models provide a set of methodologies to assess the current state of the organization in analytics, to guide development milestones, to draw organizational dimensions, and to avoid common mistakes in building process. The objective of this paper is to review and study in a systematic way these maturity models and discover the gaps and weaknesses of maturity models in the data domain. This review would pave the road towards finding a new approach for enhancing these reviewed models. The study Will be covering the existing data analytics maturity models in Business intelligence and Big Data. Systematic review practices guidelines in the field of software engineering are being used which was developed by famous researchers. This paper reviews six maturity models and discuss models details with highlighting on trends and gaps. The research paper shows a clear need for formally validated model with fully documented process focus on both organizational and technological aspects with assessment tool measure. This is in addition to the assess of the current situation of analytics effectiveness in the organization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The adequacy of business models to Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is an urgent requirement and a clear concern. Ways to recognize the relative position of a company and ways to evolve towards this new paradigm are an important step both for researchers and professionals. In general, most small and medium enterprises (SME) do not have their own resources or do not have the means to be fully supported by consultancies, to develop a specific model, and they do not recognize themselves as ready to initiate any action to adapt to this new paradigm. Based on the idea of identification of directions and opportunities of research about the conditions for the adoption of approaches involving readiness assessment, implementation framework, roadmap and maturity model, the main objective of this article is the identification of factors for the development of specific maturity models, oriented towards unique conditions, located in specific contexts, and that can cover both the need for self-diagnosis of the level of preparation, as well as the actions that aim to achieve a progressive reconfiguration and guided by continuous improvement towards Industry 4.0. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 67 articles was conducted and resulted in the identification of two approaches to address maturity models, which are the application of existing generic models and the process of building specific ones focused on the peculiarities of certain contexts. Moreover, this work points out five factors for development of a specific maturity model: context characterization, conceptual characterization, interaction with practitioners and experts, development of surveys, and qualitative research. Additionally, this work identified the need for development of methodologies that can be applied in a more autonomous way for the development of specific maturity models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In spite of its strategic importance, there is scant attention to investigating customer analytics capabilities in the retail context. Drawing on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, this study proposes a multidimensional customer analytics capability model by identifying relevant dimensions and sub-dimensions in retail settings. The principal contribution of this study is that the model links a customer analytics perspective to a resource-based view (RBV)-capability of the retailers by proposing six customer analytics capability dimensions and twelve sub-dimensions in the spectrum of market orientation and technology orientation. The customer analytics capability dimensions depict three crucial themes of marketing, such as value creation (offering capability and personalization capability), value delivery (distribution capability and communication capability), and value management (data management capability and data protection capability). By incorporating this capability dimensions, practitioners will likely be able to engage customers and enhance customer equity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The formulation and implementation of a digital transformation strategy have become a key concern for many pre-digital organizations. Consequently, there is a fundamental need to support companies in the transition to the use of technologies and to guide them to improve their capabilities in a standardized, unbiased, and repeatable manner. The paper goal is presenting the first proposal for a Digital Transformation Maturity Model (DTMM) that meets the needs and challenges of the customer experience and is aligned with the characteristics of the credit unions. The methodology used is divided into six steps, starting with a systematic review of the literature on the subject, continuing with a semi-structured interview with experts in digital transformation, and then carrying out an information gathering with experts in the cooperative sector. All the above to validate the proposal of the dimensions and maturity levels associated with the MMTD. The results obtained are an MMTD structure for the cooperative sector with seven dimensions (1) Strategy, (2) Organization, (3) Customer, (4) Ecosystems, (5) Operations, (6) Technology, and (7) Innovation and their respective components. Also, five levels are proposed to evaluate the maturity of each dimension, Pioneers (Level 5), Optimized (Level 4), Integration (Level 3), Enablement (Level 2), Initiation (Level 1), and Not initiated (Level 0). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Security is considered to be a critical software quality attribute. Tackling security at the requirements phase helps to avoid the need to rework secure software development issues. The aim of this paper is to develop a Requirements Engineering (RE) Security Maturity Model (RESMM) to assist software development organizations to better specify the requirements for secure software development. To achieve this objective, first, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the requirement practices for secure software development. Then we modified Sommerville's requirements engineering practices. We also conducted a questionnaire survey based on the identified security requirements practices. Next, the RESMM was built based on the results of the SLR, the modified Sommerville practices and feedback from the security practitioners. Finally, two case studies were conducted to assess RESMM. RESMM has 79 practices classified into 7 RE categories. The case study results show that RESMM has a clear structure and is easy to comprehend and use. In addition, the case study participants recommended that software organizations adopt RESMM. RESMM has the ability to identify the RE security maturity levels in software organizations. RESMM can also help software development organizations deliver secure software. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Maturity models have been introduced over the last five decades as guides and references for information system (IS) management in organizations from different sectors. In the education sector, maturity models have also been used to evaluate higher education institutions (HEIs) across several dimensions, such as information and communication technology (ICT), management, process management, course curricula, course/HEI accreditation, e-/m-learning, online courses and pedagogical strategies. In fact, HEIs are faced with enormous complexity due to the specificity and quantity of their processes. Based on the guidelines concerning a methodology for a systematic literature review, the maturity models of different subareas of education are identified and categorized in this paper. For each maturity model associated with HEIs’ ISs, the appropriate methodology for development and validation is identified, as well as the scope, stages and their dimensional characteristics. This study highlights the need to develop an IS maturity model that supports HEIs in their core business activities and management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the DevOps environment requires a platform that aid in evaluating the performance of existing processes and provide improvement recommendations. On top of that, organizations can only achieve the perceived benefits of DevOps if their processes are mature and continuously measured. The objective of this research is to investigate the process improvement contributions made by researchers in the DevOps field.

CM is a support process that helps organizations have better management of their infrastructure. Its importance, in the Information Technology (IT) domain, has increased in recent years, despite this process not being technologically new, and the fact that many organizations implement this process in a haphazard way, which results in it not producing the benefits that it should produce. With the intention of assessing and improving the organizations' IT processes practices and capabilities, MMs have been developed and implemented. However, the application of MM in the CM domain is yet to be explored. Design/Methodology/Approach: Two Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) and a Critical Analysis were performed. In sum, 80 scientific articles of the most rated conferences and scientific journals were analyzed and conclusions were drawn. Results: This research concludes that despite the CM process being badly implemented, using a MM this process could decrease operational costs and increase the quality management of the infrastructure. Conclusion: However, no MM has been developed so far for the CM process practices. This MM would be a viable support tool for the IT organizations providers since this would help organizations have a mature CM process and better control of their IT infrastructure. Therefore, the existence of a MM for the CM domain would be a welcome advancement that should be developed in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The use of IoT allows detecting and reporting specific parameters related to different domains of the city, such as health, waste management, agriculture, transportation, and energy. LoRa technologies, for instance, are used to develop IoT solutions for several smart city domains thanks to its available features, but sometimes people (i.e., citizens, information technology administrators, or city managers) might think that these available features involve cybersecurity risks. This study explores the cybersecurity aspects that define an assessment model of cybersecurity maturity of IoT solutions to develop smart city applications. In that sense, we perform a systematic literature review based on a top-down approach of cybersecurity incident response in IoT ecosystems. Besides, we propose and validate a model based on risk levels to evaluate the IoT cybersecurity maturity in a smart city. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, the complexity of asset and maintenance management of industrial plants and machinery in the producing industry has risen due to higher competition and volatile environments. Smart factories, Internet of Things (IoT) and the underlying digitisation of a significant number of processes are changing the way we have to think and work in terms of asset management. Existing Lean Smart Maintenance (LSM) philosophy, which focuses on the cost-efficient (lean) and the learning organization (smart) perspectives enables a value-oriented, dynamic, and smart maintenance/asset management. The associated LSM maturity model is the evaluation tool that contains the normative, strategic, and operational aspects of industrial asset management, based on which numerous reorganisation projects have already been carried out in industrial companies. However, due to the ever-increasing development of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), it is necessary to extend the model by selected aspects of digitisation and digitalisation. Based on a structured literature review (SLR) of state of the art I4.0 maturity models, we were able to investigate the essential maturity items for I4.0. To restructure and expand the existing LSM maturity model, the principle of design science research (DSR) was used. The architecture of the LSM maturity model was based on the structure of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). Further development of a Lean Smart Maintenance maturity model thus covers the future requirements of I4.0 and data science. It was possible to enhance existing categories with new artefacts from the I4.0 range to represent the influence of cyber-physical systems (CPS), (big) data and information management, condition monitoring (CM) and more. Furthermore, the originally defined LSM-Model was restructured for a more simplified application in industrial use cases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The paradigm of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is bringing about a relevant change in worldwide companies at the organizational and technological levels in terms of operations management, development of new products and services, definition of strategic plans, introduction of new technologies, and creation of new skills. Thus, companies are called to face significant challenges and they need a concrete methodology that allows them to define their digital and technological strategy and to identify the actions and technologies necessary for the complete transformation in the I4.0 perspective. Several readiness and maturity models have been proposed in recent years, but an accurate analysis and classification of these models are not yet available. For this reason, the paper aims to summarize the body of existing scientific literature on this subject and to identify the research trends of literature concerning the assessment and implementation of the I4.0 paradigm. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify and analyse the papers proposing methods and/or tools developed to assess the I4.0 maturity level of the companies and to identify the strategy necessary for the implementation of the I4.0 paradigm. Then, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) statistical method was used for detecting the main topics of the selected papers, in order to identify the research trends of the subject. The combined analysis of the contents of the papers and topics through the LDA method has allowed us to define nine research topics on the subject and to identify three research trends underlining the current literature gaps and research opportunities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A maturity model is a wide technique to measure several aspects and identify the current state of processes in an organization, which can be used as a starting point for business improvement. In the Industry 4.0 context, several terms are used to express the model, such as readiness assessment model, roadmap, framework, and maturity index. They have the same purpose of measuring how the current state of an organization unit is capable of adopting and implementing the concept of industry 4.0 in the future. Many researchers had proposed maturity models for assessing Industry 4.0 readiness and maturity since 2011 when Industry 4.0 was commenced. However, there has been no attempt to analyze empirical evidence systematically. This paper aims to analyze currently available maturity models related to Industry 4.0 and provide a synthesis on those maturity models. This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies implemented on the maturity model published in several reputable and relevant sources. It focuses on the manufacturing and logistics sectors since the processes in both sectors can be highly improved through the introduction of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and artificial intelligence. In general, the primary purpose of the review is to address the following questions: (1) Based on what dimensions do researchers develop Industry 4.0 maturity models, and what are the most used and influencing parameters in those dimensions? (2) How do those maturity models compare to each other in terms of dimension complexity, techniques, maturity leveling, and kind of application sectors of the model? In conclusion, the maturity model in the context of Industry 4.0 is promising to guide the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies at the organization level. However, just having a maturity model is not enough. More efforts are needed to facilitate the application of it. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

DevOps is the combination of Development and Operations and a new way of thinking in the software engineering domain. However, no common understanding of what it means has yet been achieved. Also, no adoption models or fine-grained maturity models to assist DevOps maturation and implementation were identified. Therefore, this research attempt to fill these gaps. A systematic literature review is performed to identify the determining factors contributing to the implementation of DevOps, including the main capabilities and areas with which it evolves. Then, two sets of interviews with DevOps experts were performed and their experience used to build the DevOps Maturity Model. The DevOps maturity model was then developed grounded on scientific and professional viewpoints. Once developed the Maturity Model was demonstrated in a real organisation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

(2016) expressed initial doubts about the quality of many of the models in their literature review. This paper extends their review by five years (2015–2019) and additionally analyzes the publication outlets as an indicator of model quality. The results strongly provide that business process maturity models are mainly released in less-recognized journals. A reason for this might be problems with replicability and relevance, which are the main criteria for acceptance in higher-quality journals. This finding motivated the derivation of literature-based criteria to increase the transparency, the replicability, and the content relevance of these models. These criteria are a first step to support researchers in publishing more transparent and replicable business process maturity models and to guide reviewers when evaluating papers that are considered for publication. In addition, practitioners benefit from more useful and accessible models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this paper we seek to identify maturity models that assess the use of Agile, Lean Startup, and UCD; characterize these maturity models; and see how they are applied and evaluated. We conducted a systematic literature mapping of maturity models published between 2001 and 2020 taking existing systematic review guidelines into account; and we analyzed the models using an adapted maturity model classification criteria. There are 35 maturity models, of which 23 are maturity models for Agile, 5 for Lean thinking, 5 for User-Centered Design, and 2 for Agile and UCD combined. We found that agile models have been published fairly consistently throughout the years (2001–2020), while Lean thinking and UCD models have mostly been published in the last decade, which might be related to the somewhat recent use of Design Thinking and Lean Startup in software engineering. However, there are no maturity models for a combined use of Agile, Lean Startup, and UCD. We believe that this is the case due to the approach’s infancy, as it is seeing success among industry practitioners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Moreover, the continuous improvement is also required in the field of Information Security Awareness (ISA). This is due to the fact, that ISA trainings have to be repeated frequently in order to keep the level of awareness of the employees up and to stay in their mind. Within our research project, we are using the Integrated Behavorial Model (IBM) as definition of ISA. The IBM includes many different aspects like knowledge, attitude, and habit. We carried out a systematic literature review to determine if a MM based on the IBM can be defined to assess the maturity of ISA. Since the IBM covers aspects of psychology, we did not only search for MM for information security, since the human factor is often neglected. Moreover, the awareness is often only assessed via the knowledge of employees. However, knowledge is only one aspect of the IBM. At the end, none of the uncovered MMs considers all aspects of the IBM. In contrast to MM for information security, MM of other fields of research are considering psychological aspects if they are dealing with human factors. Therefore, it is possible to create a MM based on the IBM for ISA. Moreover, we can easily derive some of the used assessments for our MM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: One of the main challenges of organisations today is how to navigate their development into ideal sustainable organisations. However, each readiness level requires a different rubric of indicators. Therefore, this study develops a corporate sustainability maturity model (CSMM), which can be used by organisations to conduct self-assessments, identify their current sustainability maturity levels and transition into mature sustainable organisations. Design/methodology/approach: This CSMM comprises various maturity domains, sub-domains and levels as well as a rubric of indicators for assessing the maturity of corporate sustainability. In its development, a systematic literature review examined existing maturity models, after which a pilot study, based on the literature review, content analysis and expert interviews, was used to create a prototype of the CSSM. Finally, the model was refined and expanded by considering practitioners' feedback and the tendencies of other sustainability maturity models. Findings: On the basis of the findings, some Indonesian organisations conducted sustainability activities, without having a strategic plan. Moreover, the factors driving organisations to conduct sustainability efforts included external and internal pressure. However, typical factors, such as awareness of sustainability and organisational reputation gained from conducting sustainability activities, were insignificant in the sample. Originality/value: This CSMM is the first sustainability maturity model developed for readiness assessment in an Indonesian context. Through this CSMM, organisations can determine their current readiness level of sustainability maturity and choose the correct indicators to help improve each sustainability domain in the matrix. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The maturity of practices and infrastructure in the health care domain directly impacts the quality and efficiency of health care services. Therefore, various health care administrations (e.g. from hospital management to the nationwide health authority) need to assess and improve their operational maturity. Objective: This study aimed to review and classify studies that propose/use maturity assessment or maturity models (MMs) as a vehicle to achieve operational excellence in the health care domain. Method: To achieve this objective, we performed a multivocal literature review (MLR) – a form of systematic review that includes data from the grey literature (e.g. white papers and online documents) in addition to formal, peer-reviewed literature. Results: Based on 101 sources, 80 from peer-reviewed literature and 21 from the grey literature, we identified 68 different MMs on, for example, telemedicine, care pathways and digital imaging. We reviewed them with respect to various aspects, including types of research and contribution, list of MMs proposed/used with their subject areas, elements of maturity/capability and application scope or scale. In the synthesis of empirical benefits of using MMs, two were found to be significant: (a) identifying issues and providing guidance for improvement in health care contexts, and (b) improving efficiency, effectiveness, performance and productivity. Conclusion: This MLR provides an overview of the landscape and serves as an index to the vast body of knowledge in this area. Our review creates an opportunity to cope with the challenges in obtaining an overview of the state-of-the-art and practice, choosing the most suitable models or developing new models with further specialties. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Telemedicine, seen as a solution for growing healthcare problems, is still not reaching its full potential. Telemedicine pilots can result in high costs, without successfully increasing patients' wellbeing as intended. Appropriate tools for scaling up telemedicine, like prescriptive maturity models, are needed. They can help people to assess the status quo and make progress with the scaling up process by presenting them with pre-defined improvement measures. Prior research has already led to the development of such tools, but an overview is still lacking as to which models fit which purpose and whether the measures presented are helpful and, if so, in what way. The aim of this research is to provide an overview and classification of existing prescriptive maturity models for telemedicine. A systematic literature review has been conducted and a classification scheme derived to assess the identified models. The resulting overview outlines a starting point for on-going research and presents a scheme for assessing existing models with regard to how fit they are for usage. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The advent of new technologies and change of patients’ behavioral patterns have triggered the provision of medical services through social media. Although the intersection between social media and health has received considerable research attention, there is little research on how health institutions implement social media strategy; thus a roadmap is required to navigate these technological initiatives. So, the purpose of this paper is to overcome this challenge by developing the Health 2.0 maturity model in the healthcare field. Design/methodology/approach: To obtain this aim, the mixed method was applied in this research. In the first step, qualitative research method was used. In this step, along with comprehensive literature review, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the healthcare professionals to find the practices and capabilities of Health 2.0. In the second step, the proposed key dimensions (KD) were assessed and prioritized based on the views of the healthcare professionals using the quantitative survey method. Finally, by considering the architecture of Health 2.0 maturity model, the KDs were assigned to maturity levels based on their priority of implementation using a focus group. Findings: The proposed maturity model is composed of six KDs and five maturity levels based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration architecture. The KDs, as well as their implementation order and weights in the proposed maturity model are presented as a roadmap for applying Health 2.0 effectively. Practical implications: Employing the Health 2.0 maturity model enables health institutions to assess the current social media capabilities and guide them to select appropriate strategies for progress. Due to the descriptive nature of the proposed model, it allows managers to conduct process-based assessments regarding health 2.0 implementation. Originality/value: Health 2.0 has been a recurring theme on the agenda of healthcare institutions, but no sensitive tool is available to measure its growth processes. This paper explores the much ignored but critically important subject of Health 2.0 maturity model and its implementation roadmap. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce an integrated roadmap containing the most important capabilities of Health 2.0. The proposed model is both descriptive and prescriptive in nature, and has a significant theoretical contribution to healthcare studies. This paper provides a mechanism to benchmark Health 2.0 efforts and to develop a progressive strategy that would improve its activities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore how purchasing could respond to disruptive technologies by examining the assumptions underlying purchasing strategic alignment and purchasing maturity through a contingency lens. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a systematic review across purchasing maturity and purchasing strategic alignment literature. This is supplemented with exploratory case studies to include practitioners’ views. Findings: This research demonstrates that neither purchasing maturity nor purchasing strategic alignment are suitable approaches to respond to disruptive technologies. Purchasing maturity does not allow purchasing managers to select relevant practices. It also shows no consideration of any contingencies, which practitioners highlight as important for the selection of practices. Purchasing strategic alignment includes the company strategy as a contingency but does not provide any practices to choose from. It does not include any other contextual contingencies considered important by practitioners. The findings indicate that linking the two research streams may provide a more suitable approach to responding to disruptive technologies. Research limitations/implications: This research demonstrates the requirement to develop a new approach to responding to disruptive technologies, by linking purchasing maturity and purchasing strategic alignment to contextual contingencies. This is a currently unexplored approach in academic literature, which refutes the generally accepted premise that higher maturity unilaterally supports a better positioning towards technological disruption. This research also highlights a requirement for practitioners to shift their approach to “best practices”. Originality/value: This is the first research to systematically review the relationships between purchasing maturity and purchasing strategic alignment. It adds to contingency theory by suggesting that purchasing maturity models can support the achievement of strategic alignment. Also, future research directions are suggested to explore these relationships. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to present contemporary developments in the field of digital maturity models. By conducting a systematic literature review finally 24 relevant studies including 22 different models were identified and various characteristics of different digital maturity models were extracted. Focus was placed on the dimensions used to measure digital maturity in different model approaches. Special light was shed on organizational culture and to what extent it is represented in the models. Among other things, the findings indicate, that dimensions applied in various models can be very different and that just a few models incorporate transformational in addition to digital capabilities. In particular, organizational culture as a dedicated dimension of digital maturity is represented already in a few models, which indicates the growing importance of culture as an enabler of digital transformation efforts. Beside a comprehensive overview of the most widely used dimensions measuring digital maturity, a synthesis of the most frequently addressed cultural attributes is presented in this paper as well. This review finally reveals that most of the existing models give an incomplete picture of digital maturity, that cultural attributes reflecting a digital culture are not integrated systematically, and that digital maturity models specific to the domain of services are clearly under-represented. It also clearly demonstrates that research about digital transformation maturity as a holistic concept is scarce and needs more attention by research in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Results: We present twelve comparison criteria and show how the identified AMMs differ along those criteria. Conclusion: Practitioners get an overview of existing models and can select a suitable one with the help of the comparison criteria. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The level of use of such tools vary, and different maturity models are used to represent different analytics implementations within organizations. Maturity models have been developed for both business analytics and business intelligence separately. Objective of this study is to evaluate the maturity models developed recently. The business analytics maturity models consider both technical and business aspects. A few models have considered both theoretical and practitioner knowledge. Nevertheless, a lack of consideration for theoretical knowledge in developing maturity models was noted. Most models consisted of stages where maturity is described under each level corresponding to the factors relevant to each stage. Lot of similar factors can be seen among these models. These models act like a road map to achieve business analytics maturity within enterprises. It was also found that the maturity models were developed in a developed country setting. A need for an integrated maturity model with both technical and business aspects, incorporating the theoretical knowledge base and taking factors affecting business analytics maturity in developing countries was established. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the last decades the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) have been faced with new challenges, requiring profound changes in their internal and external processes. The HEI have handled this new reality by means of the dematerialization of those processes. Thus, capable Information Systems (IS) are required to support such complex processes. Another aspect is related with the lack of standardization in the HEI’ academic management processes, each HEI works according to its own internal regulations, putting a strong barrier for the adoption of standard packages of software, as happens in enterprises with the ERP. These two factors combined, turns the work of IT managers very difficult in terms of management and knowing how really the IS is capable of support those HEI’s processes. In the education sector, the Maturity Models (MM) have been used to evaluate HEI in several dimensions, such as ICT, management, process management, course curricula, course/HEI accreditation, e/m-learning, online courses and pedagogical strategies. Based on the guidelines of a methodology for a systematic literature review, the MM of different subareas of education were identified and categorized in a previous paper. In the present paper, we perform a comparative study of those MM previously identified in the scope of our research, the HEI. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, there are limited empirical studies on in-depth analysis and validation of SOA Maturity Models (SOAMMs). Objectives: The objective is to present a comprehensive comparison of existing SOAMMs to identify the areas of improvement and the research opportunities. Methods: A systematic literature review is conducted to explore the SOA adoption maturity studies. Results: A total of 20 unique SOAMMs are identified and analyzed in detail. A comparison framework is defined based on SOAMM design and usage support. The results provide guidance for SOA practitioners who are involved in selection, design, and implementation of SOAMMs. Conclusion: Although all SOAMMs propose a measurement framework, only a few SOAMMs provide guidance for selecting and prioritizing improvement measures. The current state of research shows that a gap exists in both prescriptive and descriptive purpose of SOAMM usage and it indicates the need for further research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The implementation of software processes improvement, such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), can improve quality of software products. However, CMMI as a process improvement model has been rarely discussed in GSD context. To fill this gap a systematic literature study was conducted by using Kitchenham's method. It investigated GSD research from several databases between 2013-2018. At the end there are 12 selected papers. The findings indicate that CMMI is essential for the success of GSD projects. However, it requires multiple customizations and combinations with other standards. Concept Process Areas (PAs) and maturity level from CMMI are used in new standards Software Process Improvement (SPI) with different approaches. The results of this study are potential as a reference to develop customized CMMI to increase success rate in GSD projects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

As our need to continuous planning and improvement, the maturity model is presented as a continuous and level-based performance evaluation tool. This model shows not only the current situation, but also the closest and most desirable situation for managers. Also, maturity model determines the amount of progress based on set of specific criteria. Since security is known as a process not a product, the maturity model is also used to measure the level of organization's security. Today, because of the growing importance of security, identifying the factors that can be used to assess the level of cyber security is the ability that organizations are trying to achieve. In this paper, based on the conditions of information security and technology maturity, examining different maturity models and reviewing content literature, we propose a comprehensive framework to defining the criteria for evaluation of organizational maturity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The business benefits attained from ecodesign programs in manufacturing companies have been regularly documented by several studies from both the academic and corporate spheres. However, there are still significant challenges for adopting ecodesign, especially regarding the evaluation of these potential business benefits prior to the actual ecodesign implementation. To address such gap, this study proposes an exploratory and theory-driven framework based on logic models to support the development of business cases for ecodesign implementation. The objective is to offer an outlook into how ecodesign implementation can potentially affect key corporate performance outcomes. This paper is based on a three-stage research methodology with six steps. Two full systematic literature reviews were performed, along with two thematic analyses and a grounded theory approach with the aim of developing the business case framework, which was then evaluated by seven industry experts. This research contributes to the literature of ecodesign especially by laying out an ecodesign-instantiated logic model, which is readily available to be adapted and customized for further test and use in practice. Discussions on the usefulness and applicability of the framework and directions for future research are presented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Powerful software tools are utilized by each individual discipline, but it remains challenging to connect these into tool chains for increased efficiency. To support this endeavour, the literature on interoperability assessment was surveyed to identify concepts valuable to transfer from the interoperability to the tool integration research field. Implementation options, types of interoperability and domains described in interoperability assessment models were concepts identified as directly transferable. To avoid the problems with uptake that plague the models identified, visual analytics is suggested as a vehicle for the transfer. Furthermore, based on the use of non-functional properties as an underlying motivation for these models, cost, performance and sustainability are suggested as a common base for future research in both discourses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Applying interaction design process has become more popular in the software industry, especially in the e-Commerce industry. In order to map industry maturity towards interaction design process, we proposed an interaction design maturity measurement which will help the industry to know their current maturity in design. The aim of this study is to validate the interaction design process maturity criteria to create the interaction design process maturity measurement framework. The study is conducted by using systematic literature review. Literature are gathered from several digital libraries. To create applicable measurement, we collected interaction design process practices by interviewing representatives from three e-Commerce enterprises in Indonesia. The result of this research revealed five criteria and 36 supporting indicators. The criteria consist of management and four interaction design processes including requirement identification, alternative design development, interactive design development, and evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {IT governance (ITG) has stayed a challenging matter for years. Research suggests the existence of a gap between theoretical frameworks and practice. Although current ITG research is largely focused on hard governance (structure, processes), soft governance (behavior, collaboration) is equally important and might be crucial to close the gap. The goal of this study is to determine if there remains a mismatch and test the usability of a new ITG maturity model. We conducted a systematic literature review to create an overview of available ITG maturity models, used one of these in ten case studies and evaluated its usability. The study shows five new models were introduced, and only one of the new ITG maturity models covers hard and soft ITG in detail. This model and corresponding instrument was used to test its usability in practice. The instrument was evaluated positively on usability; but feedback also revealed that the assessment questions needed improvements. We demonstrate that combining the instrument with structured interviews results in an enhanced and usable instrument to determine an organization's current level of hard and soft ITG. We conclude that this new instrument demonstrates a way to reduce the mismatch between ITG maturity theory and practice. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Such immature practices lead to negative outcomes - for example, testing that doesn't detect all the defects or that incurs cost and schedule overruns. To conduct test maturity assessment (TMA) and test process improvement (TPI) systematically, researchers and practitioners have proposed various approaches and frameworks. Motivated by a recent industrial project in TMA and TPI and wanting to identify the state of the art and practice in this area, researchers conducted a review of both the scientific literature and practitioners' gray literature (for example, blog posts). The review identified 58 test maturity models and many sources with varying degrees of empirical evidence. The review's results can serve as an evidence-based overview of and index to the vast body of knowledge in this important, fast-growing area.

This paper presents a diagnosis method called Public Administration Interoperability Diagnosis Method (PAIDM), using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as multi-criteria decision-making structure to calculate the capability levels diagnosed. A proposed development framework guides a systematic literature review, followed by a survey of experts and a set of quantitative and qualitative methods related to the extraction and modeling of the knowledge from the public administration domain mapped into theoretical, conceptual, and practical outputs devoted to PAIDM execution.

	abstract = {A world becoming more digitally transformed and connected poses significant challenges for IT organizations, requiring increased attention to the usability of their software products and, consequently, to the systematic establishment of usability engineering (UE) processes. Typically, the establishment of software processes is guided by software process capability/maturity models (SPCMMs), such as CMMI or ISO/IEC 15504. However, it seems that these commonly adopted models do not explicitly cover usability engineering (UE) processes. Thus, a question that arises is, if there exist process capability/maturity models focusing explicitly on usability engineering? If yes, to which degree do they assist in the assessment process? To answer this, we conducted a systematic literature review on usability capability/maturity models (UCMMs). A total of 15 UCMMs were identified and analyzed, synthesizing information on their measurement framework and process reference model, usage support and how they have been developed/validated. We observed that most of the models are based on consolidated SPCMMs, such as CMMI or ISO/IEC 15504. Only few UCMMs customized for specific contexts were found. Although all UCMMs propose or reference a measurement framework, only 5 UCMMs define a proper process reference model. Most of the models also do not offer support for their usage, which may hinder their larger scale adoption in practice. Furthermore, we noted a lack of information on how most of the models have been developed and validated, which leaves their validity questionable. These results indicate the need for further research on UCMMs taking into consideration the increased importance of usability in software product quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Many benefits, as improvement in decision making, reduction in the risk of development of redundant and conflicting activities, and a better use of resources can be obtained through integration. Therefore, an instrument that assesses the degree of maturity of Integrated Management Systems (IMS) should be employed in organizations for improvements in the integration. According to a literature review conducted in this study, no research that takes the concept of maturity models as a point of support has focused on the evaluation of such maturity level in IMS. An exploratory review, a systematic literature review on IMS, and a literature search regarding maturity models were performed. A tool assessed by academic experts and industry professionals was developed and involved 21 questions divided into 4 areas, namely Policy; Planning; Implementation/Execution; and Verification/Action. An overview of research into IMS, as well as the tool developed can be highlighted in the present research. It can be concluded that the number of studies on IMS has increased over the years, which is important from the point of view of both the market and the academic area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Various challenges are associated with the software process improvement (SPI). The aim of this paper is to develop a software process improvement implementation and management model (SPIIMM) that can assist GSD organizations in assessing and improving their SPI activities. A thorough systematic literature review (SLR) study was performed to identify the critical success factors (CSFs), critical barriers (CBs), and the relevant practices of SPI. An empirical study of the industry was conducted with 111 SPI experts using a survey questionnaire to verify the outcomes of the SLR. The final CSFs and CBs were categorized into five maturity levels based on the implementation maturity model, the software outsourcing vendor readiness model, and capability maturity model integration. Each maturity level consisted of different CSFs and CBs to assess and improve the SPI-related maturity level of an organization. Three case studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results revealed that SPIIMM can provide a robust framework to assess and improve SPI activities in GSD organizations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Context Software testing practices and processes in many companies are far from being mature and are usually conducted in ad-hoc fashions. Such immature practices lead to various negative outcomes, e.g., ineffectiveness of testing practices in detecting all the defects, and cost and schedule overruns of testing activities. To conduct test maturity assessment (TMA) and test process improvement (TPI) in a systematic manner, various TMA/TPI models and approaches have been proposed. Objective It is important to identify the state-of-the-art and the –practice in this area to consolidate the list of all various test maturity models proposed by practitioners and researchers, the drivers of TMA/TPI, the associated challenges and the benefits and results of TMA/TPI. Our article aims to benefit the readers (both practitioners and researchers) by providing the most comprehensive survey of the area, to this date, in assessing and improving the maturity of test processes. Method To achieve the above objective, we have performed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) study to find out what we know about TMA/TPI. A MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). We searched the academic literature using the Google Scholar and the grey literature using the regular Google search engine. Results Our MLR and its results are based on 181 sources, 51 (29%) of which were grey literature and 130 (71%) were formally published sources. By summarizing what we know about TMA/TPI, our review identified 58 different test maturity models and a large number of sources with varying degrees of empirical evidence on this topic. We also conducted qualitative analysis (coding) to synthesize the drivers, challenges and benefits of TMA/TPI from the primary sources. Conclusion We show that current maturity models and techniques in TMA/TPI provides reasonable advice for industry and the research community. We suggest directions for follow-up work, e.g., using the findings of this MLR in industry-academia collaborative projects and empirical evaluation of models and techniques in the area of TMA/TPI as reported in this article. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study addresses that gap. The paper also introduces and applies a systematic methodology for conducting literature reviews that combines concept mapping, review scoping, and a structured search and analysis process. The resulting search in Scopus and Proquest and subsequent analysis of the recent literature (2011–2016) on IA and quality, evaluation, measurement, and maturity in the context of information management yielded the following findings and recommendations. IA research and practice could do well to: pursue contingency frameworks rather than seek universal standardization; investigate the relationship between IA and the dimensions of information quality and information management quality; undertake case studies that apply more foundational IA methodologies in full; develop theories of IA maturity and IA maturity modelling methods; recognize that measurement and evaluation of information management quality and information quality are necessary elements of the IA and should be explicitly incorporated into IA methodology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the EU H2020 project Smart Mature Resilience, which takes advantage of the fact that many cities are committed to become increasingly resilient and have ongoing processes for urban resilience. Smart Mature Resilience develops resilience management guidelines based on a Resilience Maturity Model that engages a growing number of stakeholders and multi-level governance in order for cities to become vertebrae for society’s resilience backbone. In a dual approach, employing a systematic literature review of international resilience implementation approaches alongside group processes with experts, the Smart Mature Resilience project has developed a preliminary resilience maturity model consisting of five stages Starting, Moderate, Advanced, Robust and verTebrate (SMART) and a Systemic Risk Assessment Questionnaire. The SMART Resilience Maturity Model suggests two principal processes for the transition to resilience maturity: (1) A process of increasing engagement and collaboration with new stakeholder types, from local, to regional, to national to European in a growing resilience backbone, and (2) a process of quality improvement of policies for transitioning from a Safety-I to a Safety-II perspective (from risk assessment & mitigation to adaption to future surprises as conditions evolve). © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This article aims to describe and compare the most used cybersecurity capability maturity models, as a result of a systematic review (SR) of published studies from 2012 to 2017. For this, a taxonomy for comparing cybersecurity capability maturity models was developed, based on Halvorsen and Conradi’s taxonomy. Also, the taxonomy is adapted and applied to the cybersecurity capability maturity models identified in the SR. It was observed that the cybersecurity capability maturity models have similar elements because they use processes and levels of maturity, they also manage the risk, although at different levels of depth. Finally, it has been observed that each model due to its particularity has different fields of application. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background/Aim/Purpose: A commonly implemented software process improvement framework is the capability maturity model integrated (CMMI). Existing literature indicates higher levels of CMMI maturity could result in a loss of agility due to its organizational focus. To maintain agility, research has focussed attention on agile maturity models. The objective of this paper is to find the common research themes and conclusions in agile maturity model research. Methodology: This research adopts a systematic approach to agile maturity model research, using Google Scholar, Science Direct, and IEEE Xplore as sources. In total 531 articles were initially found matching the search criteria, which was filtered to 39 articles by applying specific exclusion criteria. Contribution: The article highlights the trends in agile maturity model research, specifically bringing to light the lack of research providing validation of such models. Findings: Two major themes emerge, being the coexistence of agile and CMMI and the development of agile principle based maturity models. The research trend indicates an increase in agile maturity model articles, particularly in the latter half of the last decade, with concentrations of research coinciding with version updates of CMMI. While there is general consensus around higher CMMI maturity levels being incompatible with true agility, there is evidence of the two coexisting when agile is introduced into already highly matured environments. Future Research: Future research direction for this topic should include how to attain higher levels of CMMI maturity using only agile methods, how governance is addressed in agile environments, and whether existing agile maturity models relate to improved project success. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A systematic literature review of supply chain maturity models with sustainability concerns is presented. The objective is to give insights into methodological issues related to maturity models, namely the research objectives; the research methods used to develop, validate and test them; the scope; and the main characteristics associated with their design. The literature review was performed based on journal articles and conference papers from 2000 to 2015 using the SCOPUS, Emerald Insight, EBSCO andWeb of Science databases. Most of the analysed papers have as main objective the development of maturity models and their validation. The case study is the methodology that is most widely used by researchers to develop and validate maturity models. From the sustainability perspective, the scope of the analysed maturity models is the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) and environmental dimension, focusing on a specific process (eco-design and new product development) and without a broad SC perspective. The dominant characteristics associated with the design of the maturity models are the maturity grids and a continuous representation. In addition, results do not allow identifying a trend for a specific number of maturity levels. The comprehensive review, analysis, and synthesis of the maturity model literature represent an important contribution to the organization of this research area, making possible to clarify some confusion that exists about concepts, approaches and components of maturity models in sustainability. Various aspects associated with the maturity models (i.e., research objectives, research methods, scope and characteristics of the design of models) are explored to contribute to the evolution and significance of this multidimensional area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The SLR included 70 studies that describe the architecture of MMs for different contexts. A classification scheme was defined and tested with a group of MMs. Another group of MMs adopted the AS of existing models. As a result, the MMs found were classified into nine AS’s. The AS’s derived from SW-CMM and CMMIstaged are quite similar. The ISO-SPICE-based and the OPM3-based architectures are the most different. The AS’s most used in studies were the CMMIbased and the progression-staged model. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the ability to researchers of using design of experiments (DoE) as a structured and systematic approach to performing systematic literature reviews. The authors demonstrate a simple case study illustrating the application of DoE in executing a systematic literature review on two popular topics in higher education: academic leadership and Lean Six Sigma. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology involves the systematic literature review of linking academic leadership with terms such as Lean, Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, Maturity Model and Continuous Improvement. The main tool used to structure the systematic literature review is a Taguchi Orthogonal Array design, specifically an L16 grid and the method is verified by conducting another review, replacing the term academic leadership with simply leadership. Findings – The approach identified at first no research papers linking the terms; however, when academic leadership was replaced with university, 19 research papers where discovered. The verification exercise, linking just leadership with the other search string generated over 1,000 results – demonstrating that the tool can find large volumes of articles if they exist, the search was completed for a ten year time frame – 2004 to 2014. Research limitations/implications – The case study focussed on a field which is known to have little current research and the verification exercise deliberately targeted a known large body of research. The authors will continue to use the approach and refine the technique over time. Practical implications – This approach would help any researcher despite of their discipline to identify opportunities and gaps in the current literature. Originality/value – The paper shows how DoE can be used in an academic research-based process. No other literature review approach currently exists which uses Taguchi approach to DoE to filter the search criteria. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

A SOP is different to ordinary software development outsourcing (SDO) relationship. SOP is the enhanced form of conventional outsourcing relationship. The objective of this research paper is to develop a software outsourcing partnership model (SOPM) to identify and analyze factors that are important for vendors in conversion of their existing outsourcing relationship to partnership. We have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) process for the identification of critical success factors (CSFs) from a sample of 111 articles. Further we have categorized the identified CSFs into five partnership levels based on Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Software Outsourcing Vendors' Readiness Model (SOVRM). To validate the SLR findings and to find practices for the identified CSFs a questionnaire survey was conducted in the outsourcing industry in which 35 experts, from 8 different countries participated. Two case studies were conducted for evaluation of the SOPM. In this paper our newly developed model, SOPM, has been presented in detail. SOPM has been built with the intent to assist SDO vendor organizations in measuring their capabilities for successful conversion of their contractual outsourcing relationship to outsourcing partnership. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Context The number of maturity models proposed in the area of Business Process Management (BPM) has increased considerably in the last decade. However, there are a number of challenges, such as the limited empirical studies on their validation and a limited extent of actionable properties of these models in guiding their application. These challenges hinder the widespread usage of the maturity models in the BPM field. Objective In order to better understand the state of the research on business process maturity models (BPMMs) and identify opportunities for future research, we conducted a systematic literature review. Method We searched the studies between the years 1990 and 2014 in established digital libraries to identify empirical studies of BPMMs by focusing on their development, validation, and application. We targeted studies on generic models proposed for business process maturity, business process management or orientation maturity, and selected 61 studies out of 2899 retrieved initially. Results We found that despite that many BPMMs were proposed in the last decade, the level of empirical evidence that reveals the validity and usefulness of these models is scarce. Conclusion The current state of research on BPM maturity is in its early phases, and academic literature lacks methodical applications of many mainstream BPMMs that have been proposed. Future research should be directed towards: (1) reconciling existing models with a strong emphasis on prescriptive properties, (2) conducting empirical studies to demonstrate the validity and usefulness of BPMMs, and (3) separating the assessment method used to evaluate the maturity level from the maturity model which acts as the reference framework for the assessment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Context Agile approaches are an alternative for organizations developing software, particularly for those who develop Web applications. Besides, CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) models are well-established approaches focused on assessing the maturity of an organization that develops software. Web Engineering is the field of Software Engineering responsible for analyzing and studying the specific characteristics of the Web. The suitability of an Agile approach to help organizations reach a certain CMMI maturity level in Web environments will be very interesting, as they will be able to keep the ability to quickly react and adapt to changes as long as their development processes get mature. Objective This paper responds to whether it is feasible or not, for an organization developing Web systems, to achieve a certain maturity level of the CMMI-DEV model using Agile methods. Method The proposal is analyzed by means of a systematic literature review of the relevant approaches in the field, defining a characterization schema in order to compare them to introduce the current state-of-the-art. Results The results achieved after the systematic literature review are presented, analyzed and compared against the defined schema, extracting relevant conclusions for the different dimensions of the problem: compatibility, compliance, experience, maturity and Web. Conclusion It is concluded that although the definition of an Agile approach to meet the different CMMI maturity levels goals could be possible for an organization developing Web systems, there is still a lack of detailed studies and analysis on the field. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Most of the business model depends on big data adoption and development as a major strategy to gain valuable insights and business value for competitive advantages. The trend and rapid growth of data required top management to assess the impact of big data development outcomes towards business value. An appropriate strategic assessment model should be developed to measure the capabilities of big data ecosystem during the implementation environment. This review paper presents the systematic literature review of big data assessment models were encompassed with capability components which are customized for assessing big data development. Eight models for big data readiness based on maturity model perspective were assessed and reviewed in detailed. The finding showed that big data strategic assessment model is still lacking and at its infancy stage in Information System (IS) research in helping the organization to maintain their business performance of big data implementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Software Process Improvement (SPI) programs have been implemented, inter alia, to improve quality and speed of software development. SPI addresses many aspects ranging from individual developer skills to entire organizations. It comprises, for instance, the optimization of specific activities in the software lifecycle as well as the creation of organizational awareness and project culture. In the course of conducting a systematic mapping study on the state-of-the-art in SPI from a general perspective, we observed Software Quality Management (SQM) being of certain relevance in SPI programs. In this paper, we provide a detailed investigation of those papers from the overall systematic mapping study that were classified as addressing SPI in the context of SQM (including testing). From the main study’s result set, 92 papers were selected for an in-depth systematic review to study the contributions and to develop an initial picture of how these topics are addressed in SPI. Our findings show a fairly pragmatic contribution set in which different solutions are proposed, discussed, and evaluated. Among others, our findings indicate a certain reluctance towards standard quality or (test) maturity models and a strong focus on custom review, testing, and documentation techniques, whereas a set of five selected improvement measures is almost equally addressed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Investigating theoretical basics of maturity models in knowledge management (KM) field and revealing the gaps in this domain are challenging tasks for researchers. Until today, no studies have been available summarising the theoretical foundations, methods and results of KM maturity models. To gain research objective, systematic literature review was conducted in related studies from valid scientific databases during 2000 to 2014. In this study, in addition to addressing KM paradigms generally, theoretical foundations of KM maturity researches have also been examined. The results show that functionalist is the prominent paradigm while this paradigm has been criticised in many IS researches.

The authors provide a comprehensive discussion on the literature and challenge the applicability of individual organisations evolving through maturity stages. The authors identify a significant gap in the emergence of open innovation and CMM and present a service capability sourcing model (SCSM) to bridge theses this two research areas.Practical implications – Unpacking the nature of service capabilities allows us to understand the primary components of value co-creation and their contribution towards service maturity within an open service innovation environment. The authors verify the explanation model using a cloud computing scenario within an open service innovation environment.Originality/value – The contribution of this paper is an explanation model of an open service innovation environment through our SCSM.

	abstract = {It has been shown that potential business benefits could be achieved by assessing and improving the requirements engineering (RE) process. However, process assessment models such as CMMI and ISO9000 only cover RE shallowly. Tailored models such as REGPG and REPM, on the other hand, do not cover market-driven requirements engineering. Other attempts such as MDREPM covers market-driven requirements engineering, but correspondingly neglects bespoke requirements engineering. Moreover, the area itself has evolved so practices that once were cutting edge are now commonplace. In this article, we develop and evaluate a unified requirements engineering process maturity model (Uni-REPM) that can be used in a market-driven as well as a bespoke context. This model is based on REPM, but has evolved to reflect contemporary requirements engineering practices. Uni-REPM is primarily created based on a systematic literature review of market-driven requirements engineering practices and a literature review of bespoke practices. Based on the results, Uni-REPM is formulated. The objective of Uni-REPM is twofold. Firstly, it is expected to be applicable for assessing the maturity of RE processes in various scenarios where an organisation would use different development approaches. Secondly, it instructs practitioners about which RE practices to perform and their expected benefits. As an assessment instrument, Uni-REPM provides a simple and low-cost solution for practitioners to identify the status of their RE process. As a guidance tool, Uni-REPM lessens the gap between theoretical and practical worlds by transferring the available RE technologies from research to industry practice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Objective: This study seeks to evaluate, synthesize, and present results on the use of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) in combination with agile software development, and thereafter to give an overview of the topics researched, which includes a discussion of their benefits and limitations, the strength of the findings, and the implications for research and practice. Methods: The method applied was a Systematic Literature Review on studies published up to (and including) 2011. Results: The search strategy identified 3193 results, of which 81 included studies on the use of CMMI together with agile methodologies. The benefits found were grouped into two main categories: those related to the organization in general and those related to the development process, and were organized into subcategories, according to the area to which they refer. The limitations were also grouped into these categories. Using the criteria defined, the strength of the evidence found was considered low. The implications of the results for research and practice are discussed. Conclusion: Agile methodologies can be used by companies to reduce efforts in getting to levels 2 and 3 of CMMI, there even being reports of applying agile practices that led to achieving level 5. However, agile methodologies alone, according to the studies, were not sufficient to obtain a rating at a given level, it being necessary to resort to additional practices to do so. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Thus, the alignment can be facilitated by the exploitation of enterprise models as an abstraction instrument. In this respective the paper analyses the methods for capability design and development from the enterprise modelling perspective by conducting a mapping study, i.e. the level of methodological support for capability modelling is investigated. For this purpose 112 journals and 24 conference proceedings were analysed. The most important findings are that the research in capability design (i) adopts empirical research, mostly in form of case studies and surveys (ii) is mainly motivated by Resource Based View (RBV) and changing environments (iii) proposes development approaches and frameworks as solution artefacts, (iv) lately receives attention in the Information Systems Development & Tools of MIS subject classification lately, (v) provides a scarce methodological support that is mostly represented as procedures and most importantly (vi) only to some extent exploit enterprise models that could enhance stakeholder communication at various abstraction levels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Management systems (MSs) are implemented worldwide and by an increasing number of companies. Integrated management systems (IMSs) consider the implementation of one or several MSs usually coexisting with the quality management subsystem (QMS). It is intended in this chapter to report a model based on two components that enables the assessment of the IMS maturity, considering the key process agents (KPAs) identified through a systematic literature review and the results collected from two surveys. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The model proposition considers results of a systematic literature review about CMMI and agile, and a case study about QA in an organization with CMMI and agile. The methodology for model evaluation started with a check of its process areas adherence with other maturity models and with agile practices and activities. A survey based on expert opinion was also performed. Five maturity levels and eighteen process areas compose AgileQA-RM. Each process area has mandatory purpose, expected results and informative work products. Initial model assessments indicates that it can contribute to help organizations assessing its current situation about agile QA practices and supporting quality improvement through adoption of agile QA practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this research synthesis is to gather and integrate findings on Collaborative Planning Forecast and Replenishment (CPFR) as a business process and as a management practice; and to assemble quantitative evidence of its impact on supply chain (SC) performance.Design/methodology/approach - The researchers independently conducted a systematic review of 629 abstracts and 47 full-text papers. Original keywords were applied to four key electronic databases for operations management and information systems. Rigorous and verifiable selection criteria governed inter-coders reliability, review of steps and exclusion of papers. Resource and dependency-based view of the firm, contingency research and maturity models informed the analysis.Findings - There is not a single "blueprint" for CPFR. Competing models emphasize the need for "trust and confidence" and reliable data systems. The type of products, scope, spatial diversity and number of partners in the network are important contextual variables. Firm resources that are unique and advantages from multiple and reciprocal dependencies are powerful levers. There is no consensus on maturity model and on required investment in data and communication systems.Originality/value - This synthesis applies a rigorous review method and attempts to assemble the dispersed literature in one study, utilizing explanatory operations management and information systems theories.Practical implications - Practical implications are implementation related: cost-benefit analysis and simulations should precede full-scale collaboration. There is a consensus on starting CPFR small and expanding gradually. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The design of global supply networks has evolved from traditional lowest landed cost analysis to include more strategic concepts such as how particular network configurations might support strategic and operational capabilities. An established approach to assessing operational capabilities is the maturity model methodology where the emphasis is on notions of evolution and levels of process formality. More recently, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainable supply networks, driving industrial practitioners to also address energy and resource efficiencies and waste minimisation. However, quantitative measurement approaches such as carbon footprinting beyond the firm boundary are complex and resource intensive and present significant validation challenges. This article proposes a process maturity model-based alternative to supply network carbon measurement approaches, namely, the systematic review of organisational routines and practices relevant to sustainable manufacturing. Furthermore, the incorporation of sustainability dimensions within an established supply chain maturity model architecture provides a basis for potential trade-offs. Application of the maturity model framework in 12 case studies of international manufacturing multinationals is presented, demonstrating feasibility and utility of the approach and identifying potential drivers for manufacturing sustainability linked to the industrial supply network position, including the regulatory context, and consumer sentiment. © IMechE 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Maturity models have been developed to assist organizations to enhance software quality, and the software engineering community has proposed numerous types of these, most of them based on CMM, ISO/IEC 15504 and CMMI-DEV. The great proliferation of maturity models leads to a need for systematic approaches to build them. Aim: To discover and analyze the existing methods and recommended practices for developing maturity models. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted. Results: 1500 papers were returned as a result of the searches, from which 23 were chosen as candidates, and 7 of these, published between 2005 and 2010, were eventually selected as primary studies. Conclusions: The proposal of methods for maturity models development is an emerging topic in literature. Most published maturity models are based on practices and success factors from projects that showed good results in an organization or industry, but which lack a sound theoretical basis and methodology. The proposed methods highlight as main activities: to establish goals for maturity model development, to design model architecture, to set out capability levels and dimensions, to and pilot testing. However, the creation of an assessment questionnaire and specific activities for maintenance are poorly supported. The SLR results have served to propose a method for developing maturity models that is focused on product quality characteristics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing body of literature on sales and operation planning (S&OP), efforts to synthesise the overall state of the art of research in this area are limited. Within this context, this paper provides a systematic review of the literature on S&OP. The purpose of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to integrate the highly dispersed work on S&OP in order to identify and analyse S&OP as a business process and (ii) to assemble quantitative evidence of its impact on the performance of the firm. A literature search framework is proposed, with 271 papers reviewed and classified. The framework embraces S&OP context information, inputs and goals, structure and processes, outcomes, and results. The major expected outcome in most papers was a cross-functional integration of plans, although few studies report on the integration of finance plans into S&OP. Despite the existence of common process descriptors and definitions of S&OP, there is a lack of unifying frameworks for maturity models, measurement of S&OP, and constructs related to the firms performance. The need for additional scientifically sound survey or case study research on S&OP is emphasised. This paper contributes to a better understanding of S&OPs role as a determinant of firms performance in the supply chain. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Information security is very important as it serves to protect an organisation from any threats and risks by ensuring the information is always safe to be accessed, reliable and confidentially protected. In order to ensure information security, organisations normally introduce policies and guidelines which are made available to all members. Despite this effort however, security threats on organisations' information still occur. One of the reasons is because organisations are not aware of the information security levels that they practise. This paper discusses a measurement model for assessing information security implementation levels in organisations. The model consists of three maturity levels that determine the degrees of which information security is addressed in an organisation. The levels contain several factors that are necessary for ensuring information security. The study used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the instruments to determine the appropriate measurement parameters. The identified parameters were combined with general models and measurement standards of information security. The model can be used by organisations to determine their levels of maturity in ensuring the security of their information. This enables them to improve their current information security practices. © 2011 IEEE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents preliminary results of a systematic review performed to determine the impacts of Software Process Improvements (SPI) on developers' activities and on architectural quality. The analysis shows that most SPI research focuses on the motivations of developers like quality of work life and participation incentives, but provides little detail on the impacts of SPI on their day-to-day tasks. The impacts on product quality are limited to defect reduction, and do not consider architectural quality factors, such as changeability and stability. This study shows a very weak link between process quality, as defined by the CMMI, and architectural quality, as defined by ISO 9126. The SPI literature found by this review is mostly concerned with requirement process improvements, which are related to problem definition quality, but not to architectural quality. Future quality-oriented SPI research should therefore focus on improving design and development processes with an eye to considering architectural quality factors, or what the ISO 9126 terms "architectural capabilities". © 2011 ACM. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Software Process Improvement (SPI) is intended to improve software engineering, but can only be effective if used. To improve SPI's uptake, we should understand why organizations adopt SPI. CMM-based SPI approaches are widely known and studied. Objective: We investigated why organizations adopt CMM-based SPI approaches, and how these motivations relate to organizations' size. Method: We performed a systematic review, examining reasons reported in more than forty primary studies. Results: Reasons usually related to product quality and project performance, and less commonly, to process. Organizations reported customer reasons infrequently and employee reasons very rarely. We could not show that reasons related to size. Conclusion: Despite its origins in helping to address customer-related issues for the USAF, CMM-based SPI has mostly been adopted to help organizations improve project performance and product quality issues. This reinforces a view that the goal of SPI is not to improve process per se, but instead to provide business benefits. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
