  abstract={Global Software Development (GSD) offers many benefits. On the other hand, it also has several challenges such as its impact on software quality. The implementation of software processes improvement, such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), can improve quality of software products. However, CMMI as a process improvement model has been rarely discussed in GSD context. To fill this gap a systematic literature study was conducted by using Kitchenham's method. It investigated GSD research from several databases between 2013-2018. At the end there are 12 selected papers. The findings indicate that CMMI is essential for the success of GSD projects. However, it requires multiple customizations and combinations with other standards. Concept Process Areas (PAs) and maturity level from CMMI are used in new standards Software Process Improvement (SPI) with different approaches. The results of this study are potential as a reference to develop customized CMMI to increase success rate in GSD projects.},

  abstract={Background: Maturity models have been developed to assist organizations to enhance software quality, and the software engineering community has proposed numerous types of these, most of them based on CMM, ISO/IEC 15504 and CMMI-DEV. The great proliferation of maturity models leads to a need for systematic approaches to build them. Aim: To discover and analyze the existing methods and recommended practices for developing maturity models. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted. Results: 1500 papers were returned as a result of the searches, from which 23 were chosen as candidates, and 7 of these, published between 2005 and 2010, were eventually selected as primary studies. Conclusions: The proposal of methods for maturity models development is an emerging topic in literature. Most published maturity models are based on practices and success factors from projects that showed good results in an organization or industry, but which lack a sound theoretical basis and methodology. The proposed methods highlight as main activities: to establish goals for maturity model development, to design model architecture, to set out capability levels and dimensions, to and pilot testing. However, the creation of an assessment questionnaire and specific activities for maintenance are poorly supported. The SLR results have served to propose a method for developing maturity models that is focused on product quality characteristics.},

  abstract={One of the key indicators of success in deploying business processes in organizations is to pay attention to the organization's current status and its proper targeting for the future. As our need to continuous planning and improvement, the maturity model is presented as a continuous and level-based performance evaluation tool. This model shows not only the current situation, but also the closest and most desirable situation for managers. Also, maturity model determines the amount of progress based on set of specific criteria. Since security is known as a process not a product, the maturity model is also used to measure the level of organization's security. Today, because of the growing importance of security, identifying the factors that can be used to assess the level of cyber security is the ability that organizations are trying to achieve. In this paper, based on the conditions of information security and technology maturity, examining different maturity models and reviewing content literature, we propose a comprehensive framework to defining the criteria for evaluation of organizational maturity.},

SLR was conducted on 52 articles published in the last 22 years, from 2001 to 2022. Data were collected by analyzing abstracts, article content, and keywords. Analysis was carried out by classifying articles into publication years, publication types, measurement methods, and the validity and reliability of the SCMM measurement tool. The result is that many studies need to improve in testing the validity and reliability of measuring instruments. Validity and reliability assess how accurate and consistent the measuring instrument is. The literature review results can be used as input to develop a better SCMM tool in future research.},

  abstract={Presently, a number of software development firms are being adopted offshore software development outsourcing (OSDO) mostly due to the noteworthy profits in the shape of good return on investment. However, many challenges related to OSDO are complicated especially interrelated to requirements engineering (RE) process. It is observed that RE contributes an important part in the successful execution of OSDO projects. The development of "Software Requirements Engineering Maturity Model (SREMM) in the context of OSDO" is the main focus of this research that can assist RE experts to assess and measure their RE process readiness prior to implementation RE activities in the domain of OSDO. The SREMM is based on already published literature about RE, an industrial questionnaire survey with RE experts, and the knowledge about the factors that can influence the employment of RE activities in an OSDO environment.},

  abstract={With the emergence of agile software development methods, new approaches for determining agile maturity have become necessary. Other than for traditional maturity and capability models like CMMI and ISO/IEC 15504, the field of agile maturity models is not yet settled. Even worse, a common understanding regarding agility in general and the levels of agility in particular is missing. The paper at hand aims to shed light on the field of agile maturity models with a particular focus on maturity levels, their definition, and their evaluation and computation. We conducted a systematic literature review to extract maturity levels and provide an initial harmonization of the levels found. Our findings from analyzing 19 agile maturity models show that there is yet no agreement with regard to the maturity levels. In total, 69 maturity levels have been analyzed for harmonization opportunities. Two major dimensions of maturity levels of agile maturity models could be identified: (1) team-related and (2) general maturity, which is comparable to standard approaches. However, the procedures to assess organizations and processes, if at all present, are to a large extent focused on persons and their personal opinion, which paves the way for future research, e.g., in terms of developing measurement systems for assessing agile maturity.},

  abstract={While there has been an increasing number of studies on smart cities, there are still issues in assessment and governance of these cities. This study aims to analyze and provide insights into the research done in smart city maturity models by conducting a systemically review of related literature. The study discusses and analyzes 22 maturity frameworks from the peer-reviewed articles. The discussion also included the alignment of the smart city to the United Nations sustainable development goals. The analysis shows that there is an increased emphasis on the development of maturity models over the years 2011–2018 However, only 9 out of the 22 models were comprehensive, other models were focused on specific aspects such as citizens, data and IoT. In addition, 50% of the models from the literature included components related to technology but most of the models lacked assessment of the environmental aspects. This review indicates the need for a comprehensive smart cities' maturity model to assess the cities in their smartness transformation.},

  abstract={In many companies, software testing practices and processes are far from mature and are usually conducted in an ad hoc fashion. Such immature practices lead to negative outcomes—for example, testing that doesn’t detect all the defects or that incurs cost and schedule overruns. To conduct test maturity assessment (TMA) and test process improvement (TPI) systematically, researchers and practitioners have proposed various approaches and frameworks. Motivated by a recent industrial project in TMA and TPI and wanting to identify the state of the art and practice in this area, researchers conducted a review of both the scientific literature and practitioners’ gray literature (for example, blog posts). The review identified 58 test maturity models and many sources with varying degrees of empirical evidence. The review’s results can serve as an evidence-based overview of and index to the vast body of knowledge in this important, fast-growing area. Using this knowledge, both researchers and practitioners should be able to assess and improve the maturity of test processes.},

  abstract={With the advent COVID-19 pandemic, it has been proved that we live in a VUCA world. However, humanity was able to sustain the pandemic through knowledge sharing with their peers. This proves that the organization needs to engage effectively with its stakeholders to maintain itself in the VUCA world. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are no exception in such a scenario. However, there are various enablers and inhibitors in knowledge exchange dynamics (KED) in a university setting. So based on this, the study develops an inhibitor-based model for implementing KED in university projects. The inhibitors are identified through a systematic literature review and validated by experts, such as academicians and their stakeholders. Prioritizing these inhibitors allowed the expert to concentrate on the most critical inhibitors using the Orders of Magnitude-Analytic Hierarchy Process. Using the priority weights obtained from the model, a capability maturity model is developed to assess a university's capability and maturity level for a successful KED. From the capability maturity model results, one can understand the specific inhibitors that act as a hindrance to KED and set agenda for improvement for HEIs.},

  abstract={Agile methods are extensively adapted by software development organizations due to the competitive benefits it offers. In recent years global software development (GSD) projects practice agile methods as prominent methods to deliver the software in increments with utmost user satisfaction and affordable cost. Beside the use of agile methods, the software industry has also considered the green aspect of software, to be in line with the demands of the organizations and the world technological ecosystem. The green and sustainable feature of software should focus both the energy and resource efficiency key factors. This phenomenon of embedding the green flavor in software has emerged a new research area, green software engineering, that promises the development of eco-friendly software with minimum energy and use of less computing resources, to trim down the adverse effects on both society and environment. The principal objective of this research study is to design and develop a multi-level Green-Agile Maturity Model (GAMM) to assess the GSD vendors’ agile maturity in terms of green software development. The model has been built in four phases. In phase I and II, systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to identify the success factors and risk factors that either supports or hinders the green and sustainable software development respectively by practicing the agile methods in GSD. The results have been validated from 106 relevant experts, dealing with agile and green software projects, through questionnaire survey. The experts’ demographic represents 25 different countries. We also identified the industry practices through SLR and survey, to address our identified critical factors. Phase III of this research deals with development of the GAMM by categorizing the identified factors into seven Green-Agile maturity levels. A similar approach has been used in other models such as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Implementation Maturity Model (IMM) and Software Outsourcing Vendors Readiness Model (SOVRM). In phase IV of this research, five case studies were conducted at GSD organizations, to evaluate the structure and efficacy of the GAMM, while as a major contribution, this paper presents our developed model, the GAMM, which aims to assess the green-agile maturity of the GSD vendors in terms of green and sustainable software development.},

The C2M model aims to help organizations to identify the maturity of communication-related aspects and processes providing a tool to reveal what practices need to be improved. The model is composed of three maturity areas respectively organized into factors, goals, and practices. It has been preliminarily evaluated in two steps. First, two focus group meetings were conducted in two organizations aiming to identify how fit the model is to attend its purpose. Second, a diagnosis activity was conducted in two organizations aiming to observe how the model is perceived when used in practice. The experts who participated in the diagnosis activity reported that the application of the model allowed them to become aware of communication issues their teams were facing that they had no knowledge of. Their positive feedback is an initial indication that the model is fit to point out the maturity of communication processes and practices in distributed software projects.},

  abstract={There is a growing interest among organisations to assess and improve digital capabilities. Thus, a digital maturity model can assist organisations in planning and navigating their digital transformation. The challenge is that there are several maturity models to choose from. This paper aims to review the most recent digital maturity models from an enterprise architecture design perspective to understand, tailor, and adopt the appropriate model. This paper presents a systematic review of 30 selected maturity models across 36 papers. Further, the review results were synthesised and analysed using the adaptive enterprise architecture as a theoretical lens. This review reveals that digital maturity models still lack the ability to capture a holistic picture of digital maturity from an enterprise design perspective. The results of this review can be further casted into developing digital maturity principles and metamodel.},

  year={2025},
  volume={13},

  pages={97647-97680},
  abstract={The adoption of Extreme Programming (XP), a widely recognized Agile methodology, faces numerous barriers that hinder its successful implementation in software development organizations. This research aims to develop a novel Scalable Agile Maturity Assessment Model (SAMAM) to address these barriers and facilitate the effective adoption of XP. The model is designed by leveraging established frameworks, including the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Software Outsourcing Vendor Readiness Model (SOVRM), and Software Process Improvement Implementation Management Model (SPIIMM). Unlike traditional models that rely on predefined Key Process Areas (KPAs), SAMAM adopts 14 critical barriers (CBs) identified through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and corresponding practices as the foundation for its maturity levels. The study was conducted in four phases. First, an SLR was performed to identify 14 critical barriers to XP adoption and their respective mitigation practices. In the second phase, a survey questionnaire was administered within the software industry to validate the SLR findings and extract additional industry-relevant practices. The third phase involved the development of SAMAM, structured into five maturity levels using the identified barriers and practices instead of traditional KPAs. In the final phase, industrial case studies were conducted to evaluate the model’s effectiveness in real-world settings using the Motorola Assessment Tool. The findings demonstrate that SAMAM provides a comprehensive and scalable approach to assess and improve XP adoption maturity by systematically addressing critical adoption barriers. The model supports organizations in overcoming XP adoption challenges and achieving higher process maturity. The evaluation through case studies confirmed the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model, contributing to the body of knowledge on agile methodologies and advancing XP adoption in the software development industry.},

  abstract={Information security is very important as it serves to protect an organisation from any threats and risks by ensuring the information is always safe to be accessed, reliable and confidentially protected. In order to ensure information security, organisations normally introduce policies and guidelines which are made available to all members. Despite this effort however, security threats on organisations' information still occur. One of the reasons is because organisations are not aware of the information security levels that they practise. This paper discusses a measurement model for assessing information security implementation levels in organisations. The model consists of three maturity levels that determine the degrees of which information security is addressed in an organisation. The levels contain several factors that are necessary for ensuring information security. The study used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the instruments to determine the appropriate measurement parameters. The identified parameters were combined with general models and measurement standards of information security. The model can be used by organisations to determine their levels of maturity in ensuring the security of their information. This enables them to improve their current information security practices.},

  abstract={Maturity models (MM) have been introduced, over the last five decades, as guides and references for the information system management in organizations from different sectors of activities. In the education sector, MM have also been used to evaluate higher education institutions (HEI) in several dimensions, such as ICT, management, process management, course curricula, course/HEI accreditation, e/m-learning, online courses and pedagogical strategies. The HEI have an enormous complexity due to the specificity and quantity of their processes, demanding capable information systems (IS) and tools to manage these IS. Based on the guidelines of a methodology for a systematic literature review, the MM of different subareas of education are identified and categorized in this paper. For each MM associated with HEI IS, it is identified the methodology of development and validation, as well as the scope, stages and their characteristics by dimensions. This study resulted in the need to develop a MM for IS that supports HEI in their core business activities and management.},

  abstract={The impact of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) on the manufacturing industry's systems and processes extends to employees' competency requirements. This consequently requires a response in the preparation of graduates who will be ready to practice engineering with professional level technical know-how and soft skills in I4.0. The study focused on developing a conceptual I4.0 competency maturity model (I4.0CMM) and illustrating it using industrial engineering capability functions. Using the systematic mapping review approach, a gap analysis was conducted of design requirements for I4.0 competency models and frameworks in the literature as measured against predefined design requirements of an I4.0CMM. A total of 303 relevant research papers from Scopus, Web of Science online databases, and grey literature were retrieved. Twenty-five papers and documents were included in the study. The results of the review indicated that the predefined design requirements for an I4.0CMM were not all satisfied in literature. Thus, a conceptual I4.0CMM that is aligned to industrial engineering capability functions was developed and is illustrated. The I4.0CMM could be a solution in providing a comprehensive competency assessment framework for industrial engineering practice and education.},

The innovative technique known as DevOps tackles the issue of smooth coordination between teams working on development and operations. However, software development organizations are challenged while practicing DevOps since it makes broader changes in the software development process. The DevOps maturity model helps to determine the current and desired level of DevOps adoption. Different researchers and practitioners have introduced DevOps maturity models in recent years. However, no standard DevOps maturity model is available and not many researchers have focused on critically studying and evaluating existing maturity models. The study applied a systematic literature review method to choose twenty-one publications. A comparison and identification of fifteen DevOps maturity models highlighted distinct viewpoints, areas of focus, maturity levels, and validation techniques. The discussion emphasized the necessity for more empirical study on DevOps maturity, a look into model integrations, and ongoing innovation in the dynamic DevOps industry.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 can potentially serve as an effective solution for enhancing the productivity of small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs). However, the implementation of Industry 4.0 poses several challenges for these enterprises. These challenges include the limited availability of financial resources, knowledge resources, and the selection of appropriate technologies. The primary objective of this research paper is to determine the level of existing research that addresses the application of Industry 4.0 in SMEs and its ability to tackle the challenges mentioned above. In addition, this paper aims to explore the concept of the maturity model for Industry 4.0, which is used as one of the methods to guide the journey of SMEs in the transformation to Industry 4.0, as well as explore the various dimensions of the maturity model. To achieve these objectives, the PRISMA methodology has been employed, encompassing a systematic literature review that consists of three stages: identification, screening, and inclusion. The literature searches were conducted on databases such as IEEE Explorer, Scopus, and ACM Library. After a thorough search process, a total of 32 papers were selected, all of which were deemed relevant to the goals and objectives of this study.},

  pages={69605-69635},
  abstract={Digital Twins represent a powerful tool for transforming production and logistics towards Industry 4.0. They mirror physical assets in the digital world, enriching them with additional capabilities and features such as decision-making or lifecycle management. Due to the diverse possibilities associated with the Digital Twin, their design and implementation are also wide-ranging. This paper aims to contribute to the formalization and standardization of the description of Digital Twins. It presents a method for evaluating them through their lifecycle, from design to operation. The paper is based on an overview of their potential functionalities and properties with ranked stages of development. This method allows for an application-specific evaluation of Digital Twins and describes how they can be improved to suit the application better. The maturity model development follows the procedure for developing maturity models for IT management. Relevant capabilities and features were identified with a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines. The results of this review were ranked and categorized and constitute the core of the maturity model, which was validated on five use-cases from different domains in production and logistics. The maturity model assesses Digita Twins in seven categories (context, data, computing capabilities, model, integration, control, human-machine interface) with 31 ranked characteristics. It evaluates existing solutions for potential improvements for a given application or the transfer to a new use-case. The resulting method and a supplementary web service present a generalized model for the evaluation of Digital Twins. Based on a description of a potential application, this is the first step towards a systematic evaluation, improving the structured development of such applications},

  abstract={The adoption of continuous software engineering practices such as DevOps (Development and Operations) in business operations has contributed to significantly shorter software development and deployment cycles. Recently, the term MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) has gained increasing interest as a practice that brings together data scientists and operations teams. However, the adoption of MLOps in practice is still in its infancy and there are few common guidelines on how to effectively integrate it into existing software development practices. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review and a grey literature review to derive a framework that identifies the activities involved in the adoption of MLOps and the stages in which companies evolve as they become more mature and advanced. We validate this framework in three case companies and show how they have managed to adopt and integrate MLOps in their large-scale software development companies. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we review contemporary literature to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in MLOps. Based on this review, we derive an MLOps framework that details the activities involved in the continuous development of machine learning models. Second, we present a maturity model in which we outline the different stages that companies go through in evolving their MLOps practices. Third, we validate our framework in three embedded systems case companies and map the companies to the stages in the maturity model.},

  abstract={Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style for applications that are built by composing loosely coupled, interoperable services. Service identification is one of the earliest and most significant activities for successful implementation of SOA in the enterprise. Service identification aims at deriving high-quality services that satisfy the desired service design principles. However, service identification still remains a challenge for organizations due to the lack of unified, comprehensive, and systematic methods. Although, there do exist many Service Identification Methods (SIMs), the practitioners usually cannot easily select the most appropriate one, due to the heterogeneity of the existing SIMs. This research study focuses on investigating to what extent Welke's SOA Maturity Model (SOAMM) would help and influence the selection of appropriate SIM and improve its applicability. In the meanwhile, the work explores how Method Engineering (ME) approaches and techniques impact the development of SIMs and improve the applicability of these methods. The study aims at designing a systematic and truly service-oriented situational SIM in SOA for identifying high-quality services in real-life system. In this paper, we present the research agenda for adopting Welke's SOAMM as guidance to select SIMs.},

  abstract={According to a recent article by The Business Research Company, the Zero Trust security market is projected to grow from ∃39.26 billion in 2024 to ∃80.58 billion by 2028 [1]. Zero Trust is a security framework based on the principle that trust should never be implicitly granted, requiring ongoing authorization and authentication for all network traffic, devices, and users. Maturity models provide a structured approach for assessing the security levels of systems or organizations, offering a clear path for continuous improvement by breaking down complex cybersecurity domains into measurable stages. However, their effective implementation in the context of Zero Trust remains underexplored, as this model requires a more dynamic, granular approach to security that challenges traditional assessment frameworks and demands a deeper integration of identity management, access controls, real-time monitoring, and adaptive policy enforcement. This paper first reviews the evolution of Zero Trust definitions and maturity models to establish a common understanding of the scope. It then investigates existing Zero Trust maturity models, evaluating their maturity levels, implementation complexity, scalability, security effectiveness, and adaptability. Through a comparative analysis, the study aims to offer insights into how these models can support the implementation and maturation of Zero Trust strategies in organizations.},

  abstract={Corporate Digital Responsibility can contribute to guiding organizations toward responsible digitalization and or-ganizational resiliency. Yet, due to the novelty of this subject, few guidelines and frameworks exist. We propose a Corporate Digital Responsibility Maturity Model (CDR MM) as a systematic approach for organizations to assess and enhance their capabil-ities in integrating digital responsibility into their operations. Developed through design research methodology, the CDR MM comprises five dimensions and 18 focus areas. The model is the first of its kind in the context of CDR, addressing both the social and environmental aspects of digitalization. Our study diversifies the geographical scope by conducting research within the French context, contributing to the global understanding of CDR. For decision-makers, the CDR MM serves as an evaluative tool, of-fering insights into problematic areas and guiding organizational efforts to align digitalization with sustainable development. The proposed model also lays the groundwork for future research in the field, potentially leading to the development of prescriptive maturity models.},

  pages={12859-12888},
  abstract={The exponential growth of intelligent systems technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Smart Connected Products, has intensified the difficulties of data governance. Organizations adopting these technologies face challenges in managing the volume, variety, and velocity of data while ensuring quality, security, compliance, and ethical integrity. This study investigates the state of big data governance (BDG) programs in organizations leveraging intelligent systems technologies, using a systematic literature review guided by PRISMA. A synthesis of insights from 74 peer-reviewed articles, conferences, and industry reports reveals both the significant benefits of BDG such as enhanced decision-making, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance and persistent challenges, including fragmented governance frameworks, limited scalability, data quality issues, and ethical concerns. To address these gaps, this study proposes the big data governance maturity assessment model (BDG MAM), a novel framework developed to assess and enhance the maturity of BDG programs. The BDG MAM evaluates governance maturity across four key dimensions: people, process, data, and technology. It provides a structured roadmap for organizations to benchmark governance practices, prioritize improvements, and implement effective strategies. The model was validated through a pilot study conducted with a public higher learning institution, demonstrating its practical applicability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. By bridging theoretical insights with practical implementation, this study advances academic discourse and provides practitioners with a robust approach to navigate the challenges of modern data governance practices, ensuring sustainable and effective management of heterogeneous data environment.},

  abstract={Asset management plays a significant role in ensuring the system availability and sustainability of utilities, encompassing critical sectors such as electricity, water, and wastewater. An efficient asset management is a linchpin that safeguards a resilient service to the community through system availability maximization and service disruption avoidance. This study attempts to provide a systematic review of recent literature focused on the asset management of utilities, including asset lifecycle stages and management models. Based on the review, several research gaps that warrant further investigation is highlighted and verified by subject matter experts. Literature review was organized based on the four lifecycle stages of any asset which are planning, acquisition, operations and maintenance, and finally, disposal. A total of 249 articles were included and reviewed as part of this study. Most of articles reviewed tackles asset management in general and few focused on utilities’ physical asset management. Despite the importance of all four stages of assets lifecycle, researchers focused more on asset maintenance with less attention paid to the other stages. The review also highlights the need to develop a holistic asset management maturity model to identify gaps and advocate performance improvement actions. Further research on recent important development such as resiliency, digital transformation, acquisition and outsourcing strategies and their impact on assets is warranted.},

  abstract={A systematic review of studies related to big data maturity models in manufacturing is the goal of this study. To retain a competitive advantage, reduce operational expenses, and compete with larger companies in their respective markets, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) must embrace digitalization. The impact of big data on manufacturing has been significant globally. Despite the lack of foresight among American automotive SMEs regarding digitalization, benefits such as improved workflow, efficiencies, and reduced overheads are making it useful and invaluable to customers. The big data maturity model is used in this paper to assess the state of big data applications among American automotive SMEs. This paper reviewed the existing literature to achieve two objectives. First, this paper evaluates the existing literature to identify the existing Big Data Maturity Models, and then summarizes the most frequently used models. Second, to emphasize the limitations of existing Big Data maturity models.},

  abstract={Organization-wide roadmapping enables alignment across departments and business units with overarching strategic objectives, ensuring that functions such as R&D, operations, product and service development, marketing, and finance share a common understanding of priorities and timelines. However, achieving this alignment is challenging for many organizations. This is because roadmapping is inherently flexible and adaptable, often requiring a complex integration process involving a broad range of stakeholders. To address these implementation challenges, the authors carried out a series of industrial case studies, which led to the development an organization-wide roadmapping maturity model and a set of analytical dimensions. A further challenge then emerged regarding how organizations could effectively utilize the maturity model to deliver practical benefits in roadmapping implementation. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a maturity assessment approach. The approach applies the maturity model to review the past experiences and evaluate the current state of roadmapping practices to navigate towards effective organization-wide roadmapping implementation. The approach's practical relevance was demonstrated through an in-depth case study with a British material processing manufacturer. This study concludes that the approach provides organizations with a detailed understanding of their progress in developing implementation capabilities, offering valuable insights for future actions navigating towards organization-wide roadmapping.},

  abstract={In the present era, the manufacturing sector is experiencing two distinct revolutions. Industry 4.0 emphasizes machine autonomy, digitization, and problem-solving without human intervention. On the other hand, industry 5.0 represents a paradigm shift that goes beyond productivity and efficiency, focusing on reintegrating humans into the production process and recognizing their value. To remain competitive, companies must keep up with these trends and advancements. Initially, they faced challenges in adapting to the automation level of industry 4.0, but now they must embrace the new era to enhance their performance. Consequently, it is crucial to assess the maturity level of the industry in order to establish a roadmap for implementing industry 5.0. This paper conducts an exploratory literature review of 106 research papers, selected from a pool of 181 publications obtained from Scopus and Web of Science databases and analyzed in NVIVO. The study occurs qualitative research by analyzing word usage through word cloud, delve into connections between those words in particular subjects and examine existing maturity models. This study guided us towards a focal point where the intersection of Industry 5.0 and manufacturing maturity models promises rich opportunities for investigation and contribution.},

  pages={31829-31841},
  abstract={The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a framework for improving and optimizing organizational processes. DevOps is a revolutionary method that bridges the gap between software development and IT operations by encouraging cooperation and continuous improvement. The combination of CMMI with DevOps is a potential technique for improving software development processes. This systematic mapping review looks at the existing literature on the integration of CMMI and DevOps, identifying how they have been combined, the common aspects between them, the possibility and feasibility of their integration, and whether this integration leads to an improvement in the software development process. A thorough search of numerous databases was done, followed by the application of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to select relevant studies. A final pool was obtained containing 24 relevant papers. The findings show the benefits of combining CMMI and DevOps to reach a higher level of process improvement, in software development. However, a study about the integration between CMMI and DevOps was not found. Several frameworks have been developed to enhance the combination between them; most of them are models for measuring DevOps maturity based on CMMI. This review emphasizes the need for additional research to develop a model for integrating CMMI with DevOps, which will be the next step in the context of an ongoing study. By giving a comprehensive review of the present state of research, this study adds to a better understanding of how CMMI and DevOps can be effectively coupled to promote software industry advancements.},

  title={Cyber Security Maturity Assessment Framework for Technology Startups: A Systematic Literature Review}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={5442-5452},
  abstract={Cybersecurity has gained increasing importance among firms of different sizes and industries due to the significant rise of cyber-attacks over time. Technology startups are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to the lack of cyber security measures. This is because of limited human capital and financial resources to quantify cyber risks and allocate appropriate investments to cyber security. Technology startups are suppliers and vendors to large organisations such as MNCs, government and financial institutions. They could possibly have a network connection back to the large organisations and might even store confidential information of these large organisations such as financial records, personal data and other proprietary information. As such, with the lack of appropriate cyber security measures, technology startups may be an attack vector for malicious hackers to gain entry to the large organisations. Focusing on technology startups, this study conducted a systematic literature review on cyber security maturity assessment frameworks. This study addressed five research questions on the existing cyber security maturity assessment frameworks in various industries, the target for implementation, cyber security maturity level, shared control domains of these frameworks, and the quantification of the return of cyber security investments. Referring to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist, a detailed analysis was performed on 24 published research articles (out of 650) from reputable journals and conference proceedings from January 2011 to June 2022. The results revealed the lack of an end-to-end cyber security maturity assessment framework for technology startups. Despite the similarities in the cyber security maturity level for certain frameworks, the results revealed no singular framework that can evaluate the cyber security maturity level of technology startups. The results further revealed the lack of studies on the quantification of the return of cyber security investments in an end-to-end cyber security maturity assessment framework for technology startups. This put the startup in a vulnerable position since management is not able to obtain relevant data on the startup’s cyber maturity posture and without such information, they are not able to appropriately justify their security investments to mitigate the evolving cyber risks.},

  abstract={Organizations establish process models for different purposes and goals. However, they have in common issues concerning quality assurance and successful project management. Process models can be applied on different levels in process engineering, depending on whether processes are to be executed, defined or improved. Various individual methods and tools have been developed to help process engineers and members who are engineering and performing processes. These methods however do not support continuous integration into a process engineering lifecycle that consists of creating, defining, executing and improving processes. Therefore, we propose a holistic view of artifacts and activities in the process engineering lifecycle in an effort to create a consensus on what constitutes a process engineering lifecycle and take a look at recent research results covering the issues mentioned. We have identified approaches on process descriptions, on meta-models and on support in executing processes in the last years.},

  abstract={Currently, being deployed by organizations to develop high-quality software at a low cost, global software development (GSD) faces many challenges that make development activities more complex. These GSD challenges are mainly concerned with requirements to change management (RCM). RCM plays a key role in the successful execution of software projects. The objective of this paper is to identify the best practices of the RCM process by adopting a systematic literature review (SLR) and validate them using questionnaire survey with industry experts. A total of 46 best practices were identified through SLR and validated with industry experts. We have further classified the identified practices in the domain of client and vendor GSD organizations with the aim to provide a clear understanding of the RCM best practices in the context of both types of GSD organizations (client, vendor). Moreover, we have conducted a comparison analysis between SLR and questionnaire survey data and found a moderate positive correlation in the ranks of both data sets (rs = 0.522, p=0.003). In addition, the criticality of the identified best practices was assessed using the criteria of a practice having frequency ≥50%. The findings of this paper provide a framework that could help the GSD organizations to address the problems related to RCM in GSD environment.},

  abstract={Many companies strive to incorporate Industry 4.0 into their strategies, considering it the upcoming major trend with new benefits. As it continues to evolve, industrial growth and competitive advantage must understand the key factors driving Industry 4.0's development. Despite the benefits of Industry 4.0, its impact on employment, wealth and distribution in developing countries is not fully understood. In emerging economies, companies often possess restricted capabilities and typically function at a considerable distance from the frontier. Furthermore, businesses, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), do not understand the tangible benefits of Industry 4.0. At the same time, the relationships of key driving factors could differ in the context of developing countries regarding limited infrastructure, workforce skills, or different regulations. This paper examines the interrelationship of Industry 4.0 maturity models driving factors. 16 driving factors were extracted from 30 references primary studies through a structured literature review and taxonomy development and grouped into 6 domains. By using expert opinions from developing countries, the study employs a linguistic fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to quantify the interdependencies of each factor. This study found that although categorized as an affecting factor, strategy for I4.0 has the most relation to others. The findings presented in this study offer insights into the relative importance of I4.0MM driving factors, enabling policymakers, industry practitioners, and researchers to prioritize their efforts and allocate resources effectively as part of their adoption and growth strategies.},

  abstract={Due to an increasing amount of software and electronics, future technical systems will be significantly more capable than current ones, but also more complex. This increase in complexity leads to growing challenges in the context of product development. In industry, Systems Engineering (SE) is seen as a promising development approach to handle these challenges. However, despite great efforts in some cases, companies struggle with a variety of challenges when introducing SE. This paper presents an approach to facilitate the introduction of SE especially for small and medium-sized companies. For this purpose, we have developed a maturity-based implementation strategy. This strategy enables companies to determine their status and to derive strategic goals regarding their SE capability. As a first step, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to evaluate the current state of the art of SE based maturity models. We found four relevant approaches, which only cover partial areas of the introduction of SE. Subsequently, we present our approach, which was developed within a research project. In this model, the SE maturity level is determined in 3 assessment dimensions with the help of 20 action areas. Our approach is characterized in particular by an additional info box. It provides the evaluators with additional information and reflection questions for each action area to simplify the evaluation. Finally, we validate the maturity model with an industrial company.},

  abstract={Nowadays, software firms are playing very important roles in economies all over the world, and majority of these firms are Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The SMEs recognize that it is important to improve their development processes and activities in order to produce software with high quality and to be competitive in the software industry. However, several studies have shown that the SMEs used ad-hoc manner in their development processes and they suffer from lack of the knowledge and resources to do Software Process Improvement (SPI). In this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is used to identify and discuss the SPI initiatives in SME software firms. The results of the systematic review showed that the majority of software process improvement initiatives in SME firms are carried out in America and Europe. Only in one Asian country, Hong Kong was the SPI initiative considered and CMM Fast-Track was the model developed. The developed model did not cover all the CMM levels, only levels 1 and 2 were considered. In conclusion, many Software Process Improvement initiatives have been proposed for SME software firms but they have shortcomings such as lack of generalizability and take a lot of time to gain the benefits/advantage of the SPI model after implementation.},

  abstract={Presently, software firms are adopting global software development (GSD) paradigm increasingly, due to producing quality software's with low cost. But, the adoption of GSD is not straightforward, there are various complications allied with it mainly that related to requirements change management (RCM). The aim of this study is to identify project administration related challenges (CHs) that could negatively impact the RCM activities in GSD firms. We have employed systematic literature review (SLR) method in order to investigate the CHs. Using the SLR method, 10 CHs were identified. The identified CHs were categorized into three broad categories based on the size of organizations as small scale organizations (SSOs), medium scale organizations (MSOs) and large scale organizations (LSOs) in the context of GSD. The classification of the CHs was used to provide a clear picture of RCM process, and their respective CHs in organization size prospective. The study also indicated the critical challenges for RCM process implementation using the standards of the factors having a frequency ≥ 50% as critical. Our findings revealed that 3 out of ten CHs are critical for the implementation of RCM process in GSD. We believe that the findings of this paper are helpful in addressing project administration related problems of RCM practitioners in GSD, which is important for the success of GSD firms.},

Objective: This work investigates which safety practices/actions are suitable to be used in the Requirements Engineering (RE) process of SCS and how to design a safety maturity model for this area. Method: we adopted different empirical techniques to propose Uni-REPM SCS, which consists of a safety module to be included in the Unified Requirements Engineering Process Maturity Model (Uni-REPM). Results: The safety module has seven main processes, 14 sub-processes and 148 safety actions describing principles and practices that form the basis of safety processes maturity. Conclusions: Preliminary validation with two practitioners and nine academic experts indicates that the safety module can help organizations to evaluate their current safety practices with respect to their RE process. Moreover, it also offers a step-wise improvement strategy to raise their safety maturity level.},

  abstract={The number of security attacks and the impact has grown considerably in the recent several years. As a result, new emerging software development models are required that assist in developing software that is secure by default. This article reviews the most widely used security software models. It proposes a new Security Assurance Model (SAM) for Software Development that is adaptable to all contemporary scenarios, emphasizing global software development (GSD) vendor companies. The SAM of Software Development was developed after studying 11 well-known development models and analyzing results obtained from a systematic literature review (SLR) and questionnaire survey. The SAM of Software Development consists of seven security assurance levels: Governance and Security Threat Analysis, Secure Requirement Analysis, Secure Design, Secure Coding, Secure Testing and Review, Secure Deployment, and Security Improvement. The security assurance levels of SAM of software development consist of 46 critical software security risks (CSSRs) and 388 practices for addressing these risks. The proposed SAM of Software Development was assessed based on a tool created by Motorola, which is used to evaluate the present state of a company’s software processes and find areas for improvement. We conducted 3 case studies on software development companies, using data from real software projects to examine the results of a practical experiment in each company. The results of the case studies indicate that the proposed SAM of Software Development helps measure the security assurance level of an organization. In addition, it can potentially serve as a framework for researchers to develop new software security measures.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need for German automotive suppliers to adapt to the evolving electromobility landscape, further intensi-fied by concurrent trends like digitalization, work changes and sustain ability. A notable gap in the current literature is the ab-sence of a comprehensive capability model for these suppliers to manage this transformation effectively. This research aims to close this gap by identifying the essential transformation capa-bilities and developing a capability model, emphasizing 30 key capabilities clustered into superordinate dimensions and struc-tured along the fields of action of human, technology and organ-ization, the MTO approach.},

  abstract={Agile software development is considered as a game changer by some [1]. There are others who approach the domain more skeptical [2]. Clearly, there is a gap in terms of how Agile is perceived. This gap could be reduced, if proper measures would have been timely employed. Agile maturity assessment models have been helpful in providing means and guidance for reducing this gap. Yet, a detailed look into existing models, comparative studies and literature reviews in the domain suggests that the agile maturity assessment models themselves are far from being mature. Further, the gap between what the proposed models offer and what industry really needs is frequently discussed by those comparative studies. In this study, we reflect on the existing agile maturity assessment models, compare them against a comprehensive set of criteria derived from the literature and from our background in assessing the capabilities of software development organizations. We conclude that none of the analyzed agile maturity assessment models are sound enough to be used in a practical context. Nevertheless, some of the models have interesting elements that can be reused for the development of a new agile assessment model.},

  abstract={The proclamation of the fourth industrial revolution shocked the industrial world. Suddenly almost every modern enterprise aspired to become a proper "Industry 4.0" factory. In the industrial environment, a curious feeling of uncertainty grew. In order to overcome the negative perception, proper means, which establish the implementation grade and the needs for a specific Industry 4.0 measure of enterprises, have to be identified and scrutinised. The root cause can be explained quite straightforwardly: improvements in an Industry 4.0 perspective can be achieved if and only if the measurability is provided. This work analyses the state of art of existing Industry 4.0 assessment and maturity stage models. Results of this research will be used in further research to develop a specific assessment model for small and medium-sized enterprises in order to assess their progress in implementing Industry 4.0.},

  abstract={Organisations are increasingly being compelled to adopt Industry 4.0 (I4) technologies and sustainability practices to achieve higher supply chain performance. The digital manufacturing supply chain (DMSC) is still in its infancy stage. Therefore, exploring enabling factors from technological, organisational, legal, and sustainable perspectives is pursued. This study aims to identify and categorise the enabling factors of digital manufacturing supply chains while providing a holistic view of the I4 adoption in the supply chain context. A systematic literature review (SLR) on the supply chain digitalisation perspective is carried out by analysing journal articles published between 2015 to 2020. Each perspective is supported by well-established enablers, suggesting the need for prioritising each dimension for continuous improvement of SC performance. A digital manufacturing supply chain maturity model guided by enabling factors is proposed as a framework of DMSC adoption across firm-level, supply chain/industry, and ecosystem levels.},

  abstract={Software development organizations are globalizing their activities by adopting the phenomenon of global software development (GSD), mainly due to the significant return on investment it offers. Various challenges are associated with the software process improvement (SPI). The aim of this paper is to develop a software process improvement implementation and management model (SPIIMM) that can assist GSD organizations in assessing and improving their SPI activities. A thorough systematic literature review (SLR) study was performed to identify the critical success factors (CSFs), critical barriers (CBs), and the relevant practices of SPI. An empirical study of the industry was conducted with 111 SPI experts using a survey questionnaire to verify the outcomes of the SLR. The final CSFs and CBs were categorized into five maturity levels based on the implementation maturity model, the software outsourcing vendor readiness model, and capability maturity model integration. Each maturity level consisted of different CSFs and CBs to assess and improve the SPI-related maturity level of an organization. Three case studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results revealed that SPIIMM can provide a robust framework to assess and improve SPI activities in GSD organizations.},

Requirement Change Management (RCM) plays a key role in overall success of a GSD project. The objective of this study is to identify the challenges of RCM process by adopting systematic literature review (SLR) and validate them by employing questionnaire survey approach in real world practices. A total of 25 challenges were identified through SLR and empirical study. We have further classified the identified challenges into client and vendor organizations with an aim to understand RCM challenges in the context of both types of GSD organizations. The identified challenges were also categorized into three core types of the organization size (small, medium, large), that highlights the significance of each challenge for specific organizational size. The results indicate that there is a moderate correlation between the ranking of these challenges in the literature and the survey results. The finding of this study has the potential to help the GSD organizations in addressing the problems related with RCM in GSD projects.},

  abstract={Even though the implementation of different technological tools is already a trend, there are still aspects that should be refined so that companies' business processes can be improved. This is where social media comes to the foreground. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to study the evolution of research on social media implementation in the field of business process management. A systematic literature review was carried out following a search for and selection of articles that met our objective. To classify the sampled papers, we followed validated frameworks regarding social media management and business process management. Additionally, a detailed look at the sampled case studies was done to highlight companies' experiences in the field. Our final sample comprised 47 papers that simultaneously encompassed social media and business process management. The papers were classified according to their publishing frequency, the article type, both the topics and sectors to which they belonged, their methodological approaches, and the importance for business process management capability areas as well as capability subareas. Finally, word frequency queries were used to better understand diverse social media applications in business processes and to derive practical recommendations. The necessity for a multidisciplinary approach toward business processes was detected; therefore, topics, such as psychology, business economics, or information systems, were included, emphasizing innovation strategies, including gamification, big data, or crowdsourcing. Our most important recommendation concerns the evolution of business process management through different social media tools as a means to achieve a transition toward the recommended omnichannel management approach.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={101134-101154},
  abstract={The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has seen significant development, particularly with the increased adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Despite this progress, the interaction between digital and physical environments remains limited due to the visual limitations provided by the built environment. Although integrating BIM with immersive technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), is thought to be an effective solution, not all companies are able to successfully implement these integrated technologies. Therefore, it is essential to learn lessons from maturity evaluation. However, a systematic literature review (SLR) of previous works on maturity evaluation of BIM, AR/VR, and BIM-based AR/VR is lacking. The goal of this research is to provide an SLR of these studies to gain a clearer understanding of the field. From an initial cohort of 942 studies, 27 primary studies were retained based on four search engines. The SLR addresses specific research questions related to demographic information, maturity evaluation background, maturity evaluation tools and approaches, their benefits and limitations, and new perspectives. The main findings reveal that the maturity evaluation of BIM-based AR/VR is still in its early stages. The review also suggests a critical analysis of existing maturity evaluation tools, enabling the interpretation of results in an objective manner. Future research should focus on developing a standardized solution that incorporates best practices and rules that meet the needs of practitioners and researchers.},

  abstract={DevOps is welcomed by software development companies in recent years as a novel approach attached to the Agile software development methodology. Yet, they are in trouble with implementing DevOps because it doesn’t just concentrate on technological changes. It alters the software development process more broadly. To assist this challenging process, DevOps maturity models have been established by a few scholars in recent years. Nevertheless, those models consist variety of drawbacks as; the majority of them have not been properly evaluated and published. This research aimed to provide a critical evaluation of the data available in existing studies on the DevOps maturity models and to propose a DevOps adoption process improvement framework that is validated by industry practitioners. To accomplish this target, a systematic literature review was applied and studied the available DevOps maturity models, weaknesses, and strengths of those models. A new framework for DevOps process improvement is developed by monitoring and contrasting the available data. Furthermore, it was assessed by an interview survey to strengthen the research’s overall goal. The study presents a verified DevOps process improvement model which consists of four main DevOps success areas; DevOps practices, DevOps team, DevOps culture, and DevOps measurement. Each area follows five maturity levels starting with beginning to expert. This framework assists software development companies in obtaining benefits while reducing the difficulties associated with DevOps adoption.},

  abstract={The emergence of platform ecosystems has transformed the business landscape in many industries, giving rise to novel modes of interorganizational cooperation and value co-creation, as well as unconventional challenges. The vast traces of data generated by platform ecosystems makes them ripe for the use of analytics and data-driven methods aimed at improving their health, performance, business outcomes, and evolution. However, the research on the application of analytics within platform ecosystems is limited and spread across multiple disciplines. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review on the application of analytics and data-driven methods and practices within platform ecosystems. A total of 56 studies were reviewed, and underwent data extraction, analysis, and synthesis processes. In addition to presenting themes and patterns in the recent and relevant literature on platform ecosystems analytics, our review offers the following outcomes: an actionable overview of the analytics toolbox currently used within platform ecosystems—spanning domains such as machine learning, deep learning, data science, modelling, simulation, among others—; a roadmap for practitioners to achieve analytics maturity; and a summary of underexplored research areas.},

  abstract={DevOps is a culture that emphasizes team cooperation and encourages enterprises to deliver software product features through automated processes. The Internet of Things paradigm is impulsively and continuously reforming industrial endeavours. DevOps combines continuous integration followed by continuous testing which is then succeeded by continuous deployment and continuous delivery. Continuous monitoring is a nerve ending once the product is delivered. This entire combination helps to produce faster deployments with quality. The DevOps-related challenges in IoT projects are discussed in this paper. The DevOps methodology and its recommended practices are frequently used in combination with version control, monitoring, and alerting at the device level. It has outlined the software architecture for IoT devices. This study reviewed research articles to investigate challenges with the Internet of Things applications related to DevOps framework. This study also tried to explore solutions for those challenges in form of guidelines, practices to adhere to, and models suggested in various available literature. The proposed article identifies important issues that must be resolved to implement the DevOps culture in IoT applications. Additionally, the organizations' cultural difficulties confronted while placing DevOps into practice are studied and a model is developed to provide guidelines. Effectiveness measures under consideration are collaboration, sharing, efficiency, and quality (Business value). So, this study emphasizes the challenges related to these effectiveness measures. According to research, there are several obstacles to implementing a DevOps culture in IoT applications, including poor communication, less no of DevOps experts, weak collaboration, and less management support. This research suggested a new model, Industrial DevOps Maturity Model (IDMM) to provide usage guidelines that can be the solution to existing challenges related to the effectiveness measures faced while using DevOps framework in IoT applications.},

As automation and artificial intelligence (AI) become prevalent in various sectors, the field of archiving stands on the brink of significant transformation.This paper explores the integration of AI within archival appraisal processes, framed within the context of the Maturity Assessment for Appraisal (MAA) project (2023-2025). The MAA seeks to evaluate the defensibility, stability, and appropriateness of current appraisal practices while assessing the readiness of records for automated appraisal. Employing exploratory qualitative research, the study outlines a systematic approach that includes a literature review, testing of a maturity model, and consultations with archival professionals. The MAA encompasses six key dimensions: principles, vision/strategic framework, compliance, methodology, tools, and criteria, providing a structured framework for assessing the maturity of appraisal practices in the AI age. Preliminary results highlight the potential benefits of AI in enhancing appraisal efficiency and effectiveness, paving the way for more informed and defensible archival decisions. Some applied use cases are already started and primarily derived results will be highlighted},

  abstract={The development of technology that is getting smarter makes the innovative concept only applied to various devices but various systems or settings. One of them that has been sticking out is the concept of the city. The idea called a smart city is a concept that presents a smart city arrangement that can play a role in making it easier for people to get information quickly and precisely. Smart city ideas have gained relevance over the years. Smart Cities use digital technologies to improve prosperity and performance, use resources, reduce costs, and engage more effectively and actively with their citizens. Key sectors of smart cities include energy, transportation, clean water, health, and waste. Smart city is one of the innovations that is being intensively built in Indonesia as a step of modernization and technology adoption to the wider sector. Bandung, Banyuwangi, Jakarta, Makassar, Balikpapan and Yogyakarta are examples of cities in Indonesia trying to embrace the innovative city concept. The smart city concept emerged because of the dramatic changes in population in urban areas that prompted citizens, city planners, businesses, and governments to see new visions. This study will compare the application of smart city applied to other countries with Indonesia using Kitchenham’s Systematic Literature Review. Indicators from the field of application of city governance are also very diverse. From the results of this study, I hope that can help find smart city indicators that still need to be developed in Indonesia.},

  abstract={DevOps (development and operations) aims to shorten the software development process and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. To get the potential gains of DevOps, the software development industry considering global software development (GSD) environment to hire skilled human resources and round-the-clock working hours. However, due to the lack of frequent communication and coordination in GSD, the planning and managing of the requirements change process becomes a challenging task. As in DevOps, requirements are not only shaped by development feedback but also by the operations team. This means requirements affect development, development affects operations and operations affect requirements. However, DevOps in GSD still faces many challenges in terms of requirement management. The purpose of this research project is to develop a DevOps requirement change management and implementation maturity model (DevOps-RCMIMM) that could assist the GSD organizations in modifying and improving their requirement management process in the DevOps process. The development of DevOps-RCMIMM will be based on the existing DevOps and RCM literature, industrial empirical study, and understanding of factors that could impact the implementation of the DevOps requirement change management process in the domain of GSD. This vision study presents the initial results of a systematic literature review that will contribute to the development of maturity levels of the proposed DevOps-RCMIMM.},

  abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems are developed through complex engineering projects that include many stakeholders and a variety of tools and processes from different engineering backgrounds. Interoperability in these development tool chains is an important aspect for well-integrated systems. Furthermore, since full tool chain interoperability is neither possible nor necessarily desired, measuring interoperability in development environments is essential for setting the right priorities. This systematic literature review gives an overview of the literature about interoperability assessment methods. A survey was conducted through digital libraries and a total of 42 papers were read. Out of these papers, 24 different interoperability assessment models were identified and analyzed. A striking find of this study is that no proof of industrial adaptation of these models was found. In this paper, we analyze the reasons for this lack of validation in the context of CPS development.},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={The number of public and private organizations of all sizes that have developed a IS/IT (Information Systems/Information Technology) strategic planning process is gradually increasing in Brazil. As the demand for new methodologies grows, models and processes that help these organizations understand the benefits of using these mechanisms to improve their business, it becomes necessary to evaluate the maturity level of their organizational processes, especially those related to IS/IT. This paper presents a model to assess the maturity level of the IS/IT strategic planning of Brazilian governmental organizations, named MMPE-SI/TI (Gov). It was designed in accordance with the main models and standards used for national and international definition and assessment of processes and consists of a reference model (RM), an assessment method (AM) and a database of best practices (DBP) set to assist in the development of the organization's improvement plan. The definition of the model involved several steps, including: systematic review, conducting exploratory case studies, organizing a set of best practices, validation with experts from the IS/IT area, analyzing and interpreting data and improvements recommendation. The MMPE-SI/TI (Gov) model has 5 maturity levels, 6 capacity levels, 16 processes and 124 best practices for IS/IT strategic planning directed to Brazilian governmental organizations.},

  abstract={Agile software development has been adopted in the industry to quickly react to business change. Since its inception both academia and industry debate the different shades that agile processes and technical practices play in the day-to-day of students and professional developers. Efforts have been made to understand the pros and cons of the Test Driven Development (TDD) practice to develop software as part of a professional environment. Despite the effort of practitioners to list the TDD anti-patterns that unveil undesired effects in the code when practicing TDD, work is needed to understand the causes that lead to that. In that sense, this paper proposes a research project that explores the TDD anti-patterns context and what leads practitioners to face them in the software development context. As a result, we expect to offer a TDD maturity framework to help practitioners in the process of writing code guided by tests and prevent the addition of anti-patterns.},

  abstract={This study uses the current importance of searching for research lines in scientific databases as a reference, which is critical for improving the scientific management of researchers through academic bodies. As a result, the research presented here is based on an analysis of scientific mapping on the level of business digital maturity and aims to identify the status of scientific articles indexed in the SCOPUS database. The SCOPUS database search strategy was developed based on the business digital maturity level, as well as the number of indexed articles, authors, thematic areas, types of documents, scientific areas, and keywords. The methodology used is descriptive-analytical, based on a deductive-inductive method in which specific parameters were excluded from the total results obtained and, in this way, working with documents that contribute significantly to the investigation was used for the years 2018 to 2022; two types of bibliometrics, co-presence and co-authorship, were used via the VoSViewer software and the Lens.org platform; and the search keywords were business, digital maturity, and industry 4.0. As a result, the clusters formed by co-authorships and keywords are displayed, as well as the types of documents and countries that have contributed the most to the scientific mapping investigation are also displayed. Finally, this type of research allows for the development of a technology-mediated systematic review that shows the increase in publications over the course of the study.},

  abstract={Data Science (DS) has gained increased relevance due to the potential to extract useful insights from data. Quite commonly, this involves the utilization of Machine Learning (ML). The challenging pursuit of developing and productionizing ML models can be supported and automated through MLOps, a specialization of the DevOps paradigm from software development. Therefore, MLOps offers significant potential for DS projects, which are suffering from notable failure rates. Accordingly, this literature review focuses on examining the current state-of-the-art of the publications in this area. Most importantly, the analysis showed that the current MLOps approaches in the literature predominantly emphasize model development and deployment, while organizational aspects (business understanding, evaluation) in a DS project are neglected. As DS project success is not exclusively dependent on technical matters, advancing the MLOps field by bridging the gap between business objectives and the modeling perspective through appropriate frameworks should be pursued in future research.},

The use of IoT allows detecting and reporting specific parameters related to different domains of the city, such as health, waste management, agriculture, transportation, and energy. LoRa technologies, for instance, are used to develop IoT solutions for several smart city domains thanks to its available features, but sometimes people (i.e., citizens, information technology administrators, or city managers) might think that these available features involve cybersecurity risks. This study explores the cybersecurity aspects that define an assessment model of cybersecurity maturity of IoT solutions to develop smart city applications. In that sense, we perform a systematic literature review based on a top-down approach of cybersecurity incident response in IoT ecosystems. Besides, we propose and validate a model based on risk levels to evaluate the IoT cybersecurity maturity in a smart city.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of digital technologies has significantly increased energy consumption and carbon emissions, raising critical concerns about environmental sustainability. Green cybersecurity, which integrates environmental sustainability goals into security processes, is becoming increasingly vital as AI systems contribute to growing energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. This paper introduces the concept of green cybersecurity by examining how the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) can simultaneously enhance cybersecurity practices while reducing their environmental impact. Through a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, technical reports, and case studies from 2019 to 2025, we explore the potential of AI and ML to optimize energy usage, minimize electronic waste, and support the development of environmentally sustainable cybersecurity frameworks. Our findings indicate that AI and ML can drive advancements in resource management, predictive threat detection, automated response, and real-time monitoring. To assess these opportunities, we draw upon multiple theoretical frameworks, including the Systems Theory Model, Cybersecurity Maturity Model (CMM), and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Framework, which collectively emphasize the socio-technical and ethical dimensions of AI-powered cybersecurity. We also address key challenges such as high computational demands, integration complexity, lifecycle environmental impacts, and ethical concerns related to data privacy and algorithmic transparency. This study underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop security solutions that are both technologically robust and environmentally responsible.},

By accounting for the diversity of human driving behaviors, personalized modeling can improve predictive capabilities of intelligent vehicles and foster a more balanced traffic ecosystem. This paper presents a systematic review on personalization in driving behavior, evaluating their potential to enhance road safety, transportation efficiency, and human-centric mobility. It proposes a taxonomy to categorize personalized driving behaviors and surveys relevant datasets, modeling methodologies, and techniques for validating personalized driver models. Focusing on personalized driving behavior, the study emphasizes the need for intelligent vehicles to adapt to the complex and heterogeneous behaviors exhibited by human drivers to enhance predictability, responsiveness, and ultimately create a safe and efficient traffic environment. Lastly, key challenges are identified, along with promising future research directions to advance personalized driving behavior research.},

There are many problems within the management of information technology services, beginning with the planning since many organizations avoid the construction of the information technology services catalog due to the complexity of this activity and the lack of proven proposals. Therefore, the general objective of this research project is to identify and compare the existing proposals for the construction and management of this catalog. As a methodology, a systematic review of the literature was done, with several proposals for the construction and management of the catalog in public and private entities. These proposals include models, frameworks, methods, and approaches, with the purpose of highlighting the characteristics of each one and serving as a basis for catalog management on bettering the information technology services. As a result of the research carried out, 14 proposals have been found for the construction and management of the information technology services catalog, reaching the conclusion that none of the proposals complies with all the activities of the information technology service catalog management. It is also necessary to experiment with the merger of one or more proposals in order to rescue the positive aspects of each one in order to devise a better proposal to properly manage information technology service catalogs, which guaranteeing its validity over time.},

  abstract={Tourism is one of Indonesia's main economic drivers because it can absorb many workers and bring in foreign exchange through tourism activities. Research related to Smart Tourism Destinations (STDs) and the technology that supports them has gained popularity and has received special attention in the last ten years. STDs show that various technologies are applied to a tourist destination, one of which aims to increase added value for the surrounding community and tourists. This study employs the systematic literature review (SLR) method to investigate smart tourism destinations and governance topics. This research aims to identify and analyze the main components of Smart Tourism Destinations Governance. Two research questions were developed and incorporated into the search term. This research resulted in 24 research papers on smart tourism destinations and governance. The result of this study is a proposed IT Governance Model, which can be a guideline for tourism's DMOs (Destination Management Organizations), tourism enterprises, IT companies that support smart tourism concepts, and policymakers (government) to improve their service to society/community. The model can be used as a guide to governing the IT implementation in smart tourism destinations projects. Limitations of this study regarding the scalability of database and keyword usage and their methodologies. Theoretical implication for scholars in the next research is that research can be conducted on how to implement this model and whether this model can be easily adopted. This future work also regarding the IT Governance Maturity Model or the measurement of IT Gov readiness in smart tourism destinations.},

  abstract={In today's fast-changing world of cybersecurity threats, and specifically the dynamic domain of cybersecurity education which is characterized by constant flux in the digital landscape, understanding and effectively responding to emerging challenges are critical imperatives. With a specific focus on data-driven methodologies, this literature review aims to unravel patterns and insights without delving into the analysis of human responses. The objective is to synthesize current knowledge and identify gaps for potential future research. This paper undertakes a rigorous systematic literature review, analyzing 220 publications with 73 specifically addressing cybersecurity education retrieved from esteemed databases such as Scopus. For a thorough examination, the study employs quantitative and qualitative research methods. Notably, it delves into a focused exploration of word usage through the creation of word clouds, probes the interconnections among these words within specific subjects, and scrutinizes established maturity models.},

  abstract={Safety-Critical Systems (SCS) are increasingly present in people’s daily activities. In the means of transport, in medical treatments, in industrial processes, in the control of air, land, maritime traffic, and many other situations, we use and depend on SCS. The requirements engineering of any system is crucial for the proper development of the same, and it becomes even more relevant for the development of SCS. Requirements Engineering is a discipline that focuses on the development of techniques, methods, processes, and tools that assist in the design of software and systems, covering the activities of elicitation, analysis, modeling and specification, validation, and management of requirements. The complete specification of system requirements establishes the basis for its architectural design. It offers a description of the functional and quality aspects that should guide the implementation and system evolution. In this book, we discuss essential elements of requirements engineering applied to SCS, such as the relationship between safety/hazard analysis and requirements specification, a balance between conservative and agile methodologies during SCS development, the role of requirements engineering in safety cases, and requirements engineering maturity model for SCS. This book provides relevant insights for professionals, students, and researchers interested in improving the quality of the SCS development process, making system requirements a solid foundation for improving the safety and security of future systems.},

  abstract={Open Government Data (OGD) is one of the government initiatives to gain public trust. It involves the citizens using or reuse the data so that they can make benefits from it. To implement OGD, the government shall implement several principles; there are standard data, metadata, interoperability, and reference code or master data. However, current problems and technology need to be found for a lesson learned in the next implementation. A systematic literature review was used as a methodology to find the information. And the results are 19 problems encountered and divided into seven categories: the OGD portal, engagement with the public, data quality, data utilization, organization data privacy, and data interoperability. For technology, there are seven technologies has found regarding OGD: UTAT model and trust factor, Legal open data framework towards data governance, linked open data, RST API GeoServer, Open data maturity model, Research model of post-adoption in OGD, Blockchain, and Semantic Government Vocabulary (SGoV). Findings in this research are several fundamental problems in managing portal for OGD, like updating the data and checking for the features in the portal, and the assessment toward OGD might be about corruption.},
